Existing law defines and regulates mortgages. Existing law requires a financial institution that makes loans upon the security of real property containing only a one- to 4-family residence in this state or purchases obligations secured by the property and that holds hazard insurance proceeds in a loss draft account pending property rebuilding or repair to pay interest on those funds at a rate of at least 2% simple interest per annum, as specified. Existing law requires that interest to be credited to the above-described loss draft account annually or upon termination of the account, whichever is earlier.\n\nThis bill would, instead, require that interest to be credited to the above-described loss draft account, or otherwise paid directly to the borrower, annually or upon termination of the account, whichever is earlier."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Emergency Management Assistance Compact."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
