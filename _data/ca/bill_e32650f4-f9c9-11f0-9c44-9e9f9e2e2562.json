Under existing law, whenever any veteran, widow or widower of a veteran, or spouse of a 100% disabled veteran achieves a passing score on an entrance exam, that person is required to be ranked in the top rank of the resulting eligibility list.\n\nThis bill would revise that provision to also apply to an active duty service member who achieves a passing score on an entrance exam. The bill would also provide that authorizing employers may grant a preference in hiring and promotion to the eligible spouse of an active duty service member, veteran, widow or widower of a veteran, or spouse of a 100% disabled veteran. \n\nExisting law provides that any member of the Armed Forces who successfully passes any state civil service examination, whose name is placed on an employment list, and who qualifies for veterans' preference shall be allowed the appropriate veterans' credit to the same effect as though that person were entitled to that credit at the time of the establishing of the employment list.\n\nThis bill would authorize the eligible spouse of an active duty service member, widow or widower of a veteran, or spouse of a 100% disabled veteran to receive the appropriate credit for any selection test generally related to hiring and promotional preferences. The bill would make other related changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
