If the new reimbursement rates do not take effect on July 1, 2025, existing law requires the department to provide the Legislature with a timeline for transitioning from the rates that are in effect on July 1, 2025, to the new established rates.\n\nThis bill would instead, under those circumstances, require the department to provide the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee with the department's anticipated timeline for the above-described rate transition. The bill would require that the information be sent no later than January 31, 2027, and every subsequent year until the established rates are in effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
