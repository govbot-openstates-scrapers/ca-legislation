Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to administer a grant program to carry out the purposes of the Second Chance Program. Existing law requires the grant program to, among other things, restrict eligibility to proposals that offer mental health services, substance use disorder treatment services, misdemeanor diversion programs, or a combination thereof. Existing law also establishes the Second Chance Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, which is administered by the board.\n\nExisting law, the Treatment-Mandated Felony Act, makes it a crime for a person, who has 2 or more prior convictions for a felony or misdemeanor violation of specified controlled substances crimes, to possess a hard drug, as defined, unless it has been prescribed by a doctor, among others. Under existing law, a defendant who has been charged with this crime can elect treatment, in lieu of a jail or prison sentence or probation, by pleading guilty or no contest and admitting the alleged prior convictions, waiving time for sentencing and the pronouncement of judgment, and agreeing to participate in, and complete, a detailed treatment program developed by a drug addiction expert and approved by the court.\n\nThis bill would require the Second Chance grant program to authorize eligibility for proposals that offer mental health or behavioral health services and drug court or collaborative court programs, including the treatment program under the Treatment-Mandated Felony Act. By expanding the purpose of a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Lanterman-Petris-Short Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
