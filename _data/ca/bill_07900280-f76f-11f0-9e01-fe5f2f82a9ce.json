By imposing new duties on counties, including county elections officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Elections: campaign mass mailing prohibitions."}, {"note": "", "title": "Elections: county officers: consolidation with statewide elections."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
