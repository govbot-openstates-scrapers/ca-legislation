Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager engaging in business with a health care service plan or health insurer to secure a license from the Department of Managed Health Care on or after January 1, 2027, or the date on which the department has established the licensure process, whichever is later.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager from, among other things, requiring use of only an affiliated pharmacy, as specified, and from imposing requirements, conditions, or exclusions that discriminate against a nonaffiliated pharmacy in connection with dispensing drugs. The bill would limit a pharmacy benefit manager's income to that derived from a pharmacy benefit management fee for pharmacy benefit management services provided, and would require a pharmacy benefit manager to use a passthrough pricing model. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to recover specified civil penalties and receive equitable relief for violations of the pharmacy benefit manager licensing provisions. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require a contract between a health insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027, or the date on which the Department of Managed Health Care has established the pharmacy benefit manager licensure process, whichever is later, to require the pharmacy benefit manager to be licensed and in good standing with the Department of Managed Health Care.\n\nExisting law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy that provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to cover medically necessary prescription drugs and subjects those policies to certain limitations on cost sharing and the placement of drugs on formularies. Existing law limits the maximum amount an enrollee or insured may be required to pay at the point of sale for a covered prescription drug to the lesser of the applicable cost-sharing amount or the retail price, and requires that payment apply to the applicable deductible.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, that provides prescription drug coverage from calculating an enrollee's or insured's cost sharing at an amount that exceeds the actual rate paid by the plan or insurer for the prescription drug, except as specified, and would require the contract or policy to include specified cost-sharing provisions. The bill would prohibit a contract between a pharmacy benefit manager and a health care service plan or health insurer that is executed, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, from authorizing spread pricing. Because a willful violation of the bill's requirements relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would declare that it does not narrow, abrogate, or otherwise alter the authority of the Attorney General to maintain or restore competitive, fair, and honest markets and prosecute violations of law, and would declare that the provisions of this bill are severable.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
