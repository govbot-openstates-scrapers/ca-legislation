Under existing law, it is the policy of the state that eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources supply 100% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers and 100% of electricity procured to serve all state agencies by December 31, 2045. Existing law requires the PUC, the Energy Commission, and all other state agencies to incorporate that policy into all relevant planning.\n\nThis bill would require the PUC, on or before January 1, 2028, to adopt a plan to increase the procurement of electricity generated from nuclear facilities and to phase out the procurement of electricity generated from natural gas facilities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
