Existing law also prohibits a city and county form imposing certain taxes, such as a tax upon income. \n\nThis bill would prohibit a city, county, or any political subdivision thereof from imposing a tax, fee, assessment, or charge, that is calculated, in whole or in part, based on the number of miles traveled by a motor vehicle. The bill would not prohibit the collection of tolls for the use of specific facilities, as provided. The bill would provide that any existing program, pilot program, regulation, or administrative action inconsistent with this prohibition is void and unenforceable.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
