Existing law establishes rules for the operation of an off-highway vehicle and imposes specified safety requirements, including, among other things, a requirement that a person operating an off-highway vehicle wear a safety helmet. Existing law requires every off-highway motor vehicle that is not registered under the Vehicle Code to display an identification plate or device issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, except as specified. A violation of these rules and requirements is a crime.\n\nThis bill would define the term \"off-highway electric motorcycle\" as an off-highway motorcycle subject to identification that is (1) designed by the manufacturer for operation primarily off the highway, (2) powered by an electric motor for which a motor number is not required, (3) has handlebars for steering control, (4) has a straddle seat provided by the manufacturer, (5) has two wheels, and (6) is not equipped with pedals from the manufacturer. The bill would classify an off-highway electric motorcycle as an off-highway motor vehicle, thereby subjecting off-highway electric motorcycles to the rules and regulations relating to off-highway motor vehicles. By expanding the scope of existing crimes with respect to off-highway electric motorcycles, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Off-highway motor vehicles: eMotos."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
