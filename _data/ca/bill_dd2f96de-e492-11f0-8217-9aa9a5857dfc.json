Existing law requires electrical corporations to submit information to the commission for various purposes, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, on or before December 31, 2026, to produce a report identifying opportunities and needs to provide for local and system reliability with firm zero-carbon resources over the short term, midterm, and long term, as provided. The bill would require the report to include, among other things, characterization of the resource attributes vital for local and system reliability and identification of barriers, including market barriers, to deploying firm zero-carbon resources to enhance local and system reliability.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a violation of a commission action implementing those provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
