For purposes of the transfer of a family home, that law requires the transfer to be of a principal residence of the transferor and to become the principal residence of the transferee within one year of the transfer. That law also requires the transferee to file for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption within a year of the transfer, as described.\n\nThis bill would expand the above-described exclusion to include, in the case of the purchase or transfer of a family home or a family farm, as applicable, a purchase or transfer of that family home or family farm between eligible transferees, as specified. The bill would also specify that, in the event of a transfer by certain judicial decrees, the transfer commencing either of the above-described one-year periods shall be deemed to occur as of the effective date of the final judicial decree, as specified. The bill would require a transferee to notify the assessor of the county in which the property is located of their intention to claim the exclusion, as specified. By expanding the duties of local tax officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property taxation: veterans."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
