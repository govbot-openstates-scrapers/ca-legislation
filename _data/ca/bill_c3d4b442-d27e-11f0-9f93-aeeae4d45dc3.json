Existing law authorizes a transit district to compensate a member of the governing board for attending a board meeting and for engaging in other district business, as provided.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a transit district from compensating a member of the governing board unless the member demonstrates personal use of the transit system, as specified. The bill would require the governing board of a transit district to include 2 nonvoting members and 4 alternate nonvoting members, as specified. The bill would require nonvoting members and alternate nonvoting members to have certain rights and protections, including the right to attend and participate in all public meetings of the governing board, except as specified. The bill would require the chair of the governing board of a transit district to exclude these nonvoting members from meetings discussing, among other things, negotiations with labor organizations. By expanding the duties of transit districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
