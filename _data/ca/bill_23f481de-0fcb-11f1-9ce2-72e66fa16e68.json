For purposes of the act, a manufacturer is any person who makes, and places into the stream of commerce, a product.\n\nThis bill would instead state that a manufacturer is a person who manufactures a product and who owns or is the licensee of the brand or trademark under which the product is sold, as specified.\n\nUnder the act, a manufacturer is required to provide for the safe return or appropriate disposal of an unsafe product at no cost to the end consumer or retailer in a manner that is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.\n\nThis bill would instead require the safe return or appropriate disposal of the unsafe product to be at no cost to the end consumer, a recycling center, a municipal facility that accepts the product for recycling or disposal, a retailer that sells the product, a permitted solid waste facility, a household hazardous waste collection facility, and a thrift retail store.\n\nExisting law provides that any violation of the act is subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per occurrence, up to a maximum of $20,000.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to administratively impose an administrative penalty on a person in violation of the act of $2,500 per day or $5,000 per day if the violation is intentional or knowing, as specified.
