Existing law requires higher education employers, or such representatives as they may designate, to engage in meeting and conferring with the employee organization selected as exclusive representative of an appropriate unit on all matters within the scope of representation. Existing law requires a reasonable number of representatives of an exclusive representative to have the right to receive reasonable periods of released or reassigned time without loss of compensation when engaged in meeting and conferring and for the processing of grievances prior to the adoption of the initial memorandum of understanding.\n\nThis bill would authorize an exclusive representative, in their discretion, to invite one or more members of a bargaining unit to remotely and passively observe a session held for the purpose of a meet and confer on a memorandum of understanding. The bill would prohibit, absent an agreement of the parties, a member of a bargaining unit observing a session pursuant to these provisions from receiving released or reassigned time or compensation to observe a session."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
