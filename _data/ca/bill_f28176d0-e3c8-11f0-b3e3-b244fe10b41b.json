{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1493", "title": "Charter schools: performance standards for renewal.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Charterschools", "performancestandardsforrenewal"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "The Charter Schools Act of 1992 authorizes the establishment and operation of charter schools. Existing law sets out performance standards and procedures for the renewal of the charter of an existing charter school based on the charter school's performance level as determined by data reported on the California School Dashboard, with specific requirements for renewal applicable to 3 specified tiers of performance for those charter schools.\n\nExisting law, until January 1, 2026, requires a chartering authority, in its renewal decision for the 2 lower performing tiers of charter schools, to also consider whether the charter school has shown measurable increases in academic achievement or strong postsecondary outcomes, as demonstrated by verified data, as defined. Existing law requires the State Board of Education, on or before January 1, 2021, to establish criteria to define verified data and identify an approved list of valid and reliable assessments to be used for this purpose. Existing law requires a chartering authority, after January 1, 2026, to use only the data reported on the dashboard in making a renewal decision.\n\nThis bill would require a chartering authority, in its renewal decision for the 2 lower performing tiers of charter schools, to instead consider increases in academic achievement or strong postsecondary outcomes until the student-level growth model for English language arts and mathematics, adopted by the state board, is fully implemented as to provide the 2 years of data necessary for purposes of charter school renewal. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies acting as chartering authorities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make conforming changes relating to these provisions.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
