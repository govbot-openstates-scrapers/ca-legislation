Existing law requires owners or operators of petroleum refineries to develop, install, operate, and maintain a fence-line monitoring system in accordance with guidance developed by the appropriate regional air pollution control district or regional air quality management district.\n\nThis bill would prohibit guidance adopted to implement the fence-line monitoring system from requiring the system to monitor emissions of substances that cannot be generated by the facility that is being monitored. Because the bill would require air districts to revise their guidance related to the fence-line monitoring system, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
