Brown Act, requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a legislative body, as defined, of a local agency be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend and participate. The act authorizes the legislative body of a local agency to use teleconferencing, as specified, and requires a legislative body of a local agency that elects to use teleconferencing to comply with specified requirements, including that the local agency post agendas at all teleconference locations, identify each teleconference location in the notice and agenda of the meeting or proceeding, and have each teleconference location be accessible to the public.\n\nExisting law, until January 1, 2026, authorizes the legislative body of a local agency to use alternative teleconferencing if, during the teleconference meeting, at least a quorum of the members of the legislative body participates in person from a singular physical location clearly identified on the agenda that is open to the public and situated within the boundaries of the territory over which the local agency exercises jurisdiction, and the legislative body complies with prescribed requirements. Existing law requires a member to satisfy specified requirements to participate in a meeting remotely pursuant to these alternative teleconferencing provisions, including that specified circumstances apply. Existing law establishes limits on the number of meetings a member may participate in solely by teleconference from a remote location pursuant to these alternative teleconferencing provisions, including prohibiting such participation for more than 2 meetings per year if the legislative body regularly meets once per month or less.\n\nThis bill would extend the alternative teleconferencing procedures until January 1, 2030.\n\nExisting law authorizes a member to participate remotely pursuant to the alternative teleconferencing provisions described above under specified circumstances, including participating due to emergency circumstances. Under existing law, the emergency circumstances basis for remote participation is contingent on a request to, and action by, the legislative body, as prescribed.\n\nExisting law generally requires the legislative body of the local agency or its designee, at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, to post an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session, as specified. Existing law, until January 1, 2026, authorizes a legislative body, notwithstanding that provision, to consider and take action on a request from a member to participate in a meeting remotely due to emergency circumstances if the request does not allow sufficient time to place the proposed action on the posted agenda for the meeting for which the request is made, as specified.\n\nThis bill would extend the authorization for a legislative body of a local agency to consider and take action on a request from a member to participate in a meeting remotely due to emergency circumstances as described above until January 1, 2030.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
