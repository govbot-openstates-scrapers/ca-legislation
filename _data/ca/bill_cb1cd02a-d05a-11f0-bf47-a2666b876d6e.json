Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or health insurer to use prior authorization and other utilization review or utilization management functions, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer, including those plans or insurers that delegate utilization review or utilization management functions to medical groups, independent practice associations, or to other contracting providers, to comply with specified requirements and limitations on their utilization review or utilization management functions.\n\nThis bill would require the departments to issue instructions on or before July 1, 2026, to health care service plans and health insurers to report statistics regarding covered health care services subject to prior authorization and the percentage rate at which they are approved or modified, among other things. The bill would require a health care service plan or health insurer to report those statistics, including information from another entity to which the plan or insurer delegates responsibility for prior authorization decisions, to the appropriate department on or before December 31, 2026. The bill would require the departments to evaluate these reports, identify the health care services approved at a rate that meets or exceeds the threshold rate of 90%, and, on or before July 1, 2027, publish a list of the services identified. Beginning on the date specified by the relevant department, but no later than January 1, 2028, the bill would require a plan or insurer, or its delegated entities, to cease requiring prior authorization for the most frequently approved covered health care services. The bill would authorize a plan or insurer to reinstate prior authorization for a specific health care provider if it determines that the provider has engaged in fraudulent activity or clinically inappropriate care, as specified. No later than 4 years after the cessation of prior authorization requirements, the bill would require the departments to publish reports regarding the impact of that cessation using information reported by plans and insurers, including data on reinstatements of prior authorization for specific providers. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2034. Because a willful violation of the bill's requirements relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
