Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use prior authorization and other utilization review or utilization management functions, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity.\n\nThis bill, upon communication of a decision by a health care service plan or health insurer delaying, denying, or modifying a health care service based in whole or in part on medical necessity, would authorize a provider to request review of the decision by a licensed physician, or a licensed health care professional under specified circumstances, who is competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care service being requested, and is of the same or similar specialty as the requesting provider. The bill would authorize a licensed health care professional to be the reviewer if the provider requesting peer-to-peer review is not a physician. The bill, notwithstanding any other law, would require these reviews to occur within 2 business days, or if an enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health, within a timely fashion appropriate for the nature of the enrollee's or insured's condition, as specified. If a health care service plan or health insurer fails to meet those timelines, the bill would deem the request for the health care service as approved and supersede any prior delay, denial, or modification.\n\nBecause a violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health care coverage: utilization review: appeals and grievances."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
