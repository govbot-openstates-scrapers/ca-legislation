Existing law prohibits that authorization from limiting a local educational agency's discretion and authority to prohibit an item that is likely to cause a substantial disruption of, or material interference with, the ceremony. Existing law defines \"adornment\" for these purposes as something attached to or worn with, but not replacing, the cap and gown customarily worn at school graduation ceremonies.\n\nThis bill would extend a pupil's authorization to wear an adornment to school events that are related to graduation. The bill would clarify that what constitutes traditional regalia or recognized objects of religious or cultural significance is to be determined by the pupil and the pupil's family. The bill would prohibit a local educational agency from requiring (1) a preapproval process for a pupil to exercise their rights to wear an adornment and (2) a pupil to wear a cap if the cap is incompatible with the adornment. The bill would revise the definition of \"adornment\" as it relates to a cap customarily worn at school graduation ceremonies to instead mean something attached to, worn with, or worn in place of, the cap."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
