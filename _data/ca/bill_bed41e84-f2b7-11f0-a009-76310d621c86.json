These provisions qualify this grant of powers by reserving to the Legislature the authority to prohibit investments if it is in the public interest and the prohibition satisfies standards of fiduciary care and loyalty required of a retirement board.\n\nExisting law prohibits the boards of the Public Employees' Retirement System and the State Teachers' Retirement System from making certain new investments or renewing existing investments of public employee retirement funds, including in a thermal coal company, as defined. Existing law provides that a board is not required to take any action regarding those investments unless the board determines in good faith that the action is consistent with the board's fiduciary responsibilities established in the California Constitution.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the board of a public pension or retirement system from making any additional or new investments of public employee pension or retirement funds in development projects in California or providing financing for those projects with public employee pension or retirement funds unless those projects include labor standards protections, as defined. The bill would provide that a board is not required to take action pursuant to this provision unless it determines in good faith that the action is consistent with the board's fiduciary responsibilities established in the California Constitution."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Judicial Council: sale of property."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
