The bill would delete the term \"gambling-themed games\" from the above-described provisions, and revise the description of \"gambling\" to include examples, such as lottery games, bingo, sports wagering, or any game that mimics or simulates similar gambling, as specified. The bill would make an unfair practice using or offering games of these types that use a system of payment that allows a person to play or participate in a simulated gambling program for direct or indirect consideration, as specified, and for which the person playing the simulated gambling program may become eligible for a prize or award, cash or cash equivalents, or a chance to win a prize or award, or cash or cash equivalents, in a business establishment, on the internet, or using an online application. The bill would specify that these provisions do not make a game that does not award cash prizes or cash equivalents unlawful.\n\nExisting law makes it unlawful to engage in specified activities related to gambling, including, among others, (1) proposing or drawing a lottery, (2) dealing or playing certain games played with cards, dice, or any device for money, and (3) manufacturing, repairing, or owning slot machines. A violation of these prohibitions is a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would make it unlawful for any person or entity to operate, conduct, or offer an online sweepstakes game, as defined, in this state. The bill would make it unlawful for any entity, financial institution, payment processor, geolocation provider, gaming content supplier, platform provider, or media affiliate to knowingly and willfully support directly or indirectly the operation, conduct, or promotion of an online sweepstakes game within this state. The bill would make a person who violates these provisions guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $1,000 nor more than $25,000, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or by both the fine and imprisonment. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n This bill would specify that these provisions do not make unlawful or otherwise restrict lawful games and methods used by a gambling enterprise licensed under the Gambling Control Act or operations of the California State Lottery. The bill would specify that these provisions do not make unlawful game promotions or sweepstakes conducted by for-profit commercial entities on a limited and occasional basis as an advertising and marketing tool that are incidental to substantial bona fide sales of consumer products or services and that are not intended to provide a vehicle for the establishment of ongoing gambling or gaming.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Gaming: Tribal-state gaming compacts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
