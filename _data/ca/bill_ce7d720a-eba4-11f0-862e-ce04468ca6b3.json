Existing law requires the state board to inventory sources of air pollution within the air basins of the state, determine the kinds and quantity of air pollutants, and monitor air pollutants in cooperation with districts and other agencies.\n\nThis bill would require the state board to conduct a comprehensive review, as provided, of the current ambient air quality standard for hydrogen sulfide and adopt an updated standard, as necessary, to protect public health, including the health of sensitive and overburdened communities. The bill would require the state board to conduct at least 3 public workshops during the review, including at least one in the Tijuana River Valley region and one in the Salton Sea region. The bill would require the state board to consult with local air districts, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, the State Department of Public Health, affected tribal governments, and community-based organizations. The bill would require the state board to publish, after completing the review, a publicly available report on its internet website and, no later than 12 months after publishing the report, to adopt an updated hydrogen sulfide ambient air quality standard, as necessary, to protect sensitive populations and overburdened communities."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Sales and Use Tax Law: exemptions: certified data center facilities."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
