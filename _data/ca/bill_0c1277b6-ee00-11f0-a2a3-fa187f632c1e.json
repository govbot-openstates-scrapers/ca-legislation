Existing law authorizes SANDAG to fix and revise from time to time and charge and collect tolls and other charges for entrance to or the use of the corridor, as provided. Existing law authorizes toll revenues to be used for specified costs, including, among other things, payments of a cooperative tolling agreement with the federal government of Mexico.\n\nThis bill would, consistent with applicable federal and state laws, authorize those toll revenues to additionally be used to assist in the maintenance of the South Bay International Boundary and Water Commission sewage treatment facility and the development of additional sanitation infrastructure projects related to the Tijuana River pursuant to an agreement with the federal government. The bill would require the repayment of bond obligations to take priority over other allocations of toll revenues.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the South Bay International Boundary and Water Commission sewage treatment facility located within the County of San Diego."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Otay Mesa East Toll Facility Act: toll revenues: environmental mitigation."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
