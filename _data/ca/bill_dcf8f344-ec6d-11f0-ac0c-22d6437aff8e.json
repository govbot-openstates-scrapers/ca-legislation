The bill would require the program to have specified purposes, including promoting enhanced and expanded environmentally sound greenways and trail networks. If the agency determines that it would benefit these purposes, the bill would authorize the agency to establish an ad hoc working group with specified members, including a representative from the Department of Parks and Recreation. The bill would authorize the agency to delegate administration of the program to the agency's Deputy Secretary for Access. The bill would also authorize the agency to administer funding for priority projects, as defined, through existing or new grants or competitive grant programs and would require that no less than 35% percent of the funding administered by the agency for the purposes of the program be allocated to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities, as defined.\n\nThis bill would make these provisions operative only upon an appropriation by the Legislature for its purposes."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Trails Conservancy."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
