{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB147", "title": "Education finance: education omnibus trailer bill.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Educationfinance", "educationomnibustrailerbill"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law requires, by no later than September 30, 2026, the State Board of Education to approve, and the State Department of Education to post on its internet website, criteria and guidance for the selection or development of inservice professional development programs for effective means of teaching literacy in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1 to 5, inclusive, with a list of inservice professional development programs that have been deemed to meet those criteria.\n\nThis bill would require the department, before incurring substantial costs for the review of professional development programs, to require that a professional development program provider that intends to submit materials for review to first declare their intent to submit one or more professional development programs for review. After a professional development program provider has declared their intent to submit one or more professional development programs for review, and until September 30, 2026, the bill would authorize the department to assess a fee on the submitting professional development program provider in an amount that shall not exceed the reasonable costs to the department to conduct a review of the submitted materials, as provided. The bill would, among other things, limit the maximum amount of a reasonable fee to no more than $10,000 for each professional development program submitted for review and would require the department to take reasonable steps to limit costs of the review and to keep the fee modest. The bill would require the department to allocate specified funds appropriated in the Budget Act of 2025 to the Marin County Office of Education to contract with a research organization or nonprofit organization with expertise in evidenced-based literacy instruction, subject to the approval of the executive director of the state board, to support the implementation of these provisions, as provided.\n\nExisting law appropriates $200,000,000 from the General Fund to the department to make available to local educational agencies to expend from the 2026\u201327 fiscal year to the 2029\u201330 fiscal year, inclusive, for purposes of training certificated and classified staff who provide literacy instruction, or who support any teacher who provides literacy instruction, to pupils in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1 to 5, inclusive, using the professional development programs that meet the above-referenced criteria and guidance. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to apportion those funds to local educational agencies in an equal amount per full-time equivalent certificated staff who teach pupils in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1 to 5, inclusive.\n\nThis bill would require the Superintendent to make those apportionments using the data submitted through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System as of October 2025.\n\n(2) The Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act, an initiative approved by the voters as Proposition 98 at the November 8, 1988, statewide general election, amended the California Constitution to, among other things, set forth a formula for computing the minimum amount of revenues that the state is required to apply for the support of school districts and community college districts based on one of 3 tests in any given fiscal year.\n\nIf the Director of Finance determines pursuant to the certification process for the state's minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts that the state has applied moneys in an amount that exceeds the minimum funding obligation for the fiscal year being certified, existing law requires the excess moneys to be credited to the fiscal year being certified.\n\nExisting law provides that $5,442,143,000 allocated in the 2022\u201323 fiscal year for specified apportionments to school districts and charter schools, and $770,786,000 allocated in the 2022\u201323 fiscal year for specified apportionments to community college districts, are excess moneys credited to the 2022\u201323 fiscal year only for the purposes of determining the state's minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts in the 2022\u201323 and 2023\u201324 fiscal years. Existing law requires 10 proportional shares of $544,214,000 and $77,079,000, respectively, of those amounts to be recognized annually, from the 2026\u201327 fiscal year through the 2035\u201336 fiscal year, for budgetary and financial reporting purposes as allocations made in the 2022\u201323 fiscal year, but prohibits those amounts from being credited as allocations made to meet the minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts in the fiscal year in which the amount is recognized for budgetary and financial reporting purposes.\n\nThis bill would reduce that allocation to schools districts and charters in the 2022\u201323 fiscal year for specified apportionments by $20,000,000 to instead be $5,422,143,000. The bill would instead require 12 proportional shares of $437,769,000 and $62,231,000, respectively, of the revised $5,422,143,000 amount and the $770,786,000 amount, respectively, to be recognized annually from the 2027\u201328 fiscal year through the 2038\u201339 fiscal year, and shares of $168,915,000 and $24,014,000, respectively, of those amounts, to be recognized in the 2039\u201340 fiscal year, for budgetary and financial reporting purposes as allocations made in the 2022\u201323 fiscal year, and would continue to prohibit those amounts from being credited as allocations made to meet the minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts in the fiscal year in which the amount is recognized for budgetary and financial reporting purposes.\n\n(3) Existing law requires the department, by July 1, 2026, to create a data collection system for salary and benefits data for represented certificated and classified nonmanagement employees and requires the data collected to include salary, benefits, and full-time equivalent employee counts for certificated employees and for specified classified bargaining unit classifications, which are required to be collected in the same manner as for certificated employees, as determined by the department. Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and direct-funded charter schools, by August 31, 2026, and by July 1 annually thereafter, to complete the data collection process and to report the data to the department.\n\nThis bill would require the department to make the data submitted by school districts, county offices of education, and direct-funded charter schools publicly available in a downloadable open file data format, as specified.\n\n(4) Existing law establishes the Student Teacher Stipend Program to support prospective educators, as defined, during their completion of 500 or more hours of student teaching, as provided, and appropriates, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the commission for allocation to support the Student Teacher Stipend Program. Existing law requires $5,000,000 of that amount to be made available to the Kern County Superintendent of Schools for specified purposes, including conducting a related multimedia campaign and the establishment of a grants management system, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead require up to $6,000,000 of that amount to be made available to the Kern County Superintendent of Schools for those same specified purposes. By reallocating the amounts of authorized uses of an existing appropriation, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(5) Existing law establishes the Classified School Employee Summer Assistance Program. Existing law authorizes school districts and county offices of education to elect to participate in the program, and authorizes a classified employee of a participating local educational agency who meets specified requirements to withhold an amount from the employee's monthly paycheck during the school year to be paid out during the summer recess period, as provided. The Budget Act of 2023, the Budget Act of 2024, and the Budget Act of 2025 appropriated $90,000,000, $99,000,000, and $90,000,000, respectively, for purposes of the program. Each annual Budget Act requires its appropriations to be available for encumbrance or expenditure for the use for the fiscal year in which the funds are appropriated, unless otherwise provided therein.\n\nThis bill would, commencing with the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, require appropriations made in the annual Budget Act for purposes of the Classified School Employee Summer Assistance Program to instead be available for encumbrance during both the fiscal year in which the funds are appropriated and the immediately following fiscal year. By extending the time for which previously appropriated moneys are available, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(6) Existing law authorizes a school district, county office of education, or charter school, beginning July 1, 2025, to implement attendance recovery programs for pupils to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, as specified. For the purposes of computing average daily attendance for these attendance recovery programs, existing law prescribes general minimum daily instructional minute requirements on all local educational agencies, as provided, and specific schoolday and instructional minute requirements on county community schools, continuation high schools, juvenile court schools, and community day schools that are applicable to those settings, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, for the purposes of computing average daily attendance for these attendance recovery programs for opportunity schools, instead apply the instructional minute requirements that are applicable to opportunity schools.\n\n(7) Existing law establishes the Golden State Teacher Grant Program under the administration of the Student Aid Commission. Existing law requires the commission, among other grants within the program, for California resident applications received under the program on July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025, inclusive, to provide reduced one-time grants of up to $5,000 to each student enrolled in a professional preparation program leading to a preliminary teaching credential or a pupil personnel services credential if the student commits to working at a priority school or a California preschool program for 2 years within 4 years following the date the student completes the professional preparation program, as specified.\n\nThe bill would extend the availability of those grant program funds to applications received under the program on July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026, inclusive. By expanding the time in which applications can be received under the program, which is funded by an existing appropriation, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(8) Existing law requires the local control funding formula to include, in addition to the base grant, supplemental and concentration grant add-ons that are based on the percentage of pupils who are unduplicated pupils, as defined to include English learners, pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals, and foster youth, as specified. Notwithstanding any other law, for purposes of the local control funding formula for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u201327 fiscal years only, existing law requires the count of English learner pupils enrolled in transitional kindergarten to be equal to the count of English learner pupils enrolled in kindergarten, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine a proxy count of English learner pupils enrolled in a transitional kindergarten that is based upon the percentage of English learners enrolled in kindergarten who are either not eligible for free or reduced-price meals or not a foster youth.\n\n(9) The Budget Act of 2020, among other things, allocates $350,000 of specified appropriated funds to a county office of education selected by the executive director of the State Board of Education for the purpose of convening a workgroup that will design a state standardized individualized education program (IEP) template. The Budget Act of 2022, among other things, allocates $200,000 of specified appropriated funds to be available on a one-time basis for the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to convene a panel to continue refining the IEP template for usability, as provided. Existing law, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent to allocate to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence for the digitization of the IEP template. Existing law requires the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, in consultation with the executive director of the state board, to enter into a contract with a California special education student information system vendor to convert the IEP template into a user-dynamic software platform, develop an interactive digital version of the IEP template that is accessible to the public at no cost, and make those digitized templates available to local educational agencies and to the public, respectively, on or before June 30, 2026. Existing law requires the department, by January 1, 2027, or no later than 18 months after the IEP template is converted to a digital platform, whichever date comes first, to translate the IEP template into the top 10 most commonly spoken languages used across the state other than English and, among other things, to make those templates available on its internet website, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the contracted vendor to be a vendor that currently transmits federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act-compliant data to the department through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System and would require the vendor, upon the availability of the translated IEP template, as specified, to integrate those translations into the digitized IEP template in order to ensure that users can access the IEP template in the top 10 most commonly spoke languages used in California other than English.\n\n(10) Existing law appropriates, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, $160,000,000 from the General Fund to the department to establish the Universal School Meals Support Grant, as provided. Of that amount, existing law requires (A) $145,000,000 to be made available to award to local educational agencies to expend for specified purposes for the continued implementation of universal school meals, (B) $10,000,000 to be provided to local educational agencies to support the retention and recruitment of food service workers, as specified, and (C) $5,000,000 to be made available to the department to contract with the Marin County Office of Education for a study of particularly harmful ultraprocessed foods being offered in school meals in California, as provided. Existing law requires the Marin County Office of Education to contract with the University of California for purposes of the study and requires the department to provide a report to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2027, again on or before January 1, 2030, and finally on or before January 1, 2032, with the findings of the study.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, (A) requiring the above-described $5,000,000 to instead be made available to the department for allocation to the Marin County Office of Education for a study of ultraprocessed foods of concern and restricted school foods instead of particularly harmful ultraprocessed foods, (B) specifying that the Marin County Office of Education is required to contract with the University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources' Nutritional Policy Institute for those purposes, (C) requiring the department, in consultation with the State Department of Public Health, to approve the scope of work, timelines, and study elements, (D) changing all references for these purposes from particularly harmful ultraprocessed foods to ultraprocessed foods of concern, as defined, and restricted school foods, as defined, and (E) extending the reporting deadlines, as provided. By revising the purposes of an existing appropriation, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(11) The bill would update cross references and make nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(12) Certain funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.\n\n(13) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 45500 of the Education Code proposed by AB 378 to be operative only if this bill and AB 378 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(14) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
