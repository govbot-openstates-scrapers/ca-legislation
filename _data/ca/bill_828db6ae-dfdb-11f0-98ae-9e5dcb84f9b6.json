The act requires each state agency to divert at least 50% of all solid waste through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. \"State agency\" is defined, for purposes of these requirements, to include the California Community Colleges. The act requires each state agency to develop and adopt an integrated waste management plan to reduce solid waste, reuse materials whenever possible, recycle recyclable materials, and procure products with recycled content in all state agency offices and facilities, including any leased locations, as provided. The act requires each state agency to submit an annual report to the department summarizing its progress in reducing solid waste by at least 50%, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require a state agency to include in its integrated waste management plan descriptions of actions to be taken to source reduce certain materials, as specified. The bill would require, on or before July 15, 2027, each state agency to submit an adopted integrated waste management plan to the department for review and approval, and would, on or before January 1, 2028, require the department to complete its review of the plans, as specified. The bill would require a state agency's annual report to include summaries of the state agency's compliance with the requirement to reduce solid waste by 50% and the requirements relating to the adoption of an integrated waste management plan. By imposing new duties on community colleges, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n This bill would require the department to provide advice to help state agencies and facilities reduce solid waste by at least 50%. The bill would, on or before January 1, 2027, require the department to publish on its internet website a list of products available for purchase by state agencies that would reduce the overall amount of plastic or paper waste generated.\n\n(2) Existing law requires plastic beverage containers sold by a beverage manufacturer, as specified, to contain a specified average percentage of postconsumer recycled plastic. Between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029, inclusive, existing law requires that percentage to be no less than 25% postconsumer recycled plastic per year, and on and after January 1, 2030, no less than 50% postconsumer recycled plastic per year.\n\nThis bill would require, on and after January 1, 2026, reportable purchases by state agencies of plastic beverage containers to be of plastic beverage containers with no less than those above-referenced percentages of postconsumer recycled plastic per year.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Solid waste: recycling: state agencies and large state facilities."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
