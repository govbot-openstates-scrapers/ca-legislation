Existing law defines \"pretrial diversion\" as the postponement of prosecution to allow the defendant to undergo mental health treatment, subject to certain requirements, such as the court is satisfied that the recommended program will meet the specialized needs of the defendant, among others. Existing law provides that a defendant is suitable for pretrial diversion if certain criteria are met, including that the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment as a condition of diversion and they will not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, among others. Existing law defines \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\" as an unreasonable risk that the defendant will commit a new violent felony, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require that the defendant agree that the recommended treatment plan will meet their specialized needs and would redefine \"pretrial diversion\" to require that the court is also satisfied that the recommended program is consistent with the underlying purpose of mental health diversion, as described. The bill would state that, notwithstanding the court's determination whether a defendant may pose an unreasonable risk that the defendant will commit a new violent felony, the court retains discretion to deny pretrial diversion if it concludes that the defendant poses an unreasonable risk to the physical safety of another."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
