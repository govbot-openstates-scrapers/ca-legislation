CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nThis bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation relating to environmental quality."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
