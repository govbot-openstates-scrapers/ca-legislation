The bill would authorize the director of the department to modify an existing panel for these purposes, if applicable. The bill would require the panel to include representatives from the State Department of Social Services and invite specified stakeholder and subject matter experts to participate.

The bill would require the first meeting to occur no later than 120 days after funding for the panel becomes available and would authorize the department to contract with academic research entities to supplement the stakeholder process.\n\nThe bill would require the panel to issue findings and recommendations to both departments by July 1, 2028, on the most effective ways to implement policies and programs to support older and aging immigrants in California, regardless of their immigration status.
