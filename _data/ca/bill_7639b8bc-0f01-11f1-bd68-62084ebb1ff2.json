The act provides that a coastal development permit is not required for the replacement of any structure, other than a public works facility, destroyed by a disaster.\n\nThis bill would limit that coastal development permit exemption to the replacement of a structure by the property owner of record for the property who was listed as the property owner of record immediately preceding the disaster. By creating additional duties for a local government in reviewing coastal development permits, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
