Except as specified, a violation of the hazardous waste control laws is a crime.\n\nThis bill would create a manufacturer responsibility program for the safe and proper management of emergency distress flares. The bill would define \"covered product\" to include certain pyrotechnic devices that meet the criteria for household hazardous waste, as specified. The bill would require a manufacturer of a covered product, individually or through a manufacturer responsibility organization, to develop and implement a manufacturer responsibility plan for the collection, transportation, and the safe and proper management of covered products, as specified. The bill would establish a process and timeline for DTSC to review and approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve a plan and for the implementation of an approved plan. The bill would require that an approved plan be published on DTSC's internet website, except for specified manufacturer data that would not be open to public inspection. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2027, DTSC to adopt regulations to implement the act.\n\nThis bill would require a manufacturer or manufacturer responsibility organization to prepare and submit to DTSC and make publicly available an annual report describing the activities carried out pursuant to the plan. The bill would require the annual report to include an application for renewal of the manufacturer's responsibility plan. The bill would require all reports and records provided to DTSC pursuant to the act to be provided under the penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n This bill would require a manufacturer or manufacturer responsibility organization to pay DTSC all actual and reasonable regulatory costs for DTSC to implement and enforce the act, as provided. The bill would authorize DTSC to use funds appropriated for purposes that are consistent with this act to implement and enforce the act and would require DTSC to repay those funds, as specified below. The bill would establish the Marine Flare Recovery Fund in the State Treasury and would require the charges collected by DTSC to be deposited into that account for expenditure by DTSC, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to cover DTSC's cost to implement and enforce the act and to repay the use of specified funds, as described above.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a manufacturer, retailer, dealer, importer, or distributor from selling, distributing, offering for sale, or importing a covered product in or into the state that contains perchlorate.\n\nBy adding new requirements to the hazardous waste control laws, this bill would expand the scope of a crime and would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
