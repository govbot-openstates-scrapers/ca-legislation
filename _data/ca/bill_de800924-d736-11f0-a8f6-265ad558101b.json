Existing law requires the board to issue a clinical social worker license to each applicant who qualifies pursuant to the act and who successfully passes a California law and ethics examination and a clinical examination.\n\nThis bill would ratify and approve the Social Work Licensure Compact, which authorizes member states to issue multistate licenses to applicants meeting specified education and experience requirements. Under the compact, a multistate license grants the holder an authorization to practice in other member states. The compact provides for the creation of a commission and requires the board to select a delegate to serve on the commission. This bill would require the board to comply with the requirements of the compact and to adopt regulations necessary to implement that compact.\n\nExisting law prohibits an individual from styling themselves, or holding themselves out to be, a \"licensed clinical social worker,\" and makes it unlawful to engage in the practice of clinical social work unless they hold a license under the Clinical Social Worker Practice Act.\n\nThis bill would instead prohibit those acts unless they hold a license under the act or under the above-described compact.\n\nThis bill would become operative only upon certification by the Director of Consumer Affairs that a majority of the board has voted in favor of joining the compact and would require the director to notify the Secretary of State and the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the date of that certification."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Social workers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
