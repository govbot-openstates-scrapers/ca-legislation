Existing law makes every person who, with the intent to defraud, designs, makes, alters, or embosses a counterfeit access card or utters or otherwise attempts to use a counterfeit access card guilty of forgery. Existing law makes every person who, with the intent to defraud, uses a forged or altered card guilty of theft.\n\nThis bill would make a person who, with the intent to defraud, acquires or retains possession of a gift card or gift card redemption information, as defined, or uses an acquired or forged card, without the consent of the cardholder, card issuer, or gift card seller, or, with the intent to defraud, devises a scheme to obtain a gift card or gift card redemption information from a cardholder, card issuer, or gift card seller by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises guilty of theft, punishable as a misdemeanor, and, if the things of value that are acquired or used exceed $950, guilty of grand theft, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony. The bill would make a person who, with the intent to defraud, alters or tampers with a gift card guilty of forgery, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.
