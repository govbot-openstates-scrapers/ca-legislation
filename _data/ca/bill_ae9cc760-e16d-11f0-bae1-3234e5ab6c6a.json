The Legislature may directly amend the three strikes law by a statute passed in each house by a 23 vote, or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the voters.\n\nThis bill would expand the crimes that are within the definition of a violent felony for all purposes, including for purposes of the three strikes law, to include felony domestic violence, as specified. By expanding the scope of an enhancement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
