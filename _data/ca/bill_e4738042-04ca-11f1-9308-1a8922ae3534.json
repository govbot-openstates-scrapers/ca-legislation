Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, renewed, or delivered on or after January 1, 2024, that provides coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders to cover the provision of those services to an individual 25 years of age or younger when delivered at a schoolsite.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of schoolsite to additionally require a contract or policy that provides coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders to cover the provision of those services to an individual 25 years of age or younger when delivered at a qualified youth drop-in center. Because a violation of this requirement relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law requires a Medi-Cal managed care plan or Medi-Cal behavioral health delivery system to reimburse providers of medically necessary outpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment provided at a schoolsite to a student 25 years of age or younger who is an enrollee of the plan or delivery system, as specified.\n\nBecause of the expansion of the definition of schoolsite to include qualified youth drop-in centers, this bill would expand the above-described reimbursement requirement to those services when provided at a qualified youth drop-in center, as specified.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
