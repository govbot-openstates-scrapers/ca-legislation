Existing law establishes a governing board for the authority that comprises of representatives from specified entities, including the Mountain House Community Services District.\n\nThis bill would require a representative from the City of Mountain House to be on the governing board for the authority, instead of a representative from the Mountain House Community Services District. By imposing new duties on the City of Mountain House, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
