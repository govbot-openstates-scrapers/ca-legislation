Existing law defines \"project\" for purposes of the act to include facilities, whether or not now in existence, acquired or constructed to facilitate the movement of goods and people along the corridor or at the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast the act by, among other things, (1) revising the definition of \"project\" for purposes of the act to include facilities, whether or not now in existence, acquired or constructed to facilitate the movement of goods and people adjacent to the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry or to facilitate the generation of revenue for, or related to, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry, (2) authorizing public-private partnerships, as specified, as an alternative project delivery method, (3) authorizing SANDAG to also impose tolls and other charges for the use of a project or property covered by the act, and (4) adding payments to a private partner under a public-private partnership agreement to the categories of costs for which toll revenues are used under the act, as provided.
