Existing law, for purposes of migrant childcare and development programs, defines a \"migrant agricultural worker family\" as a family that has earned at least 50% of its total gross income from employment in fishing, agriculture, or agriculturally related work during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of application for childcare and development services. Existing law requires the children of these families to be enrolled in child development programs on the basis of specified priorities, including priority to children whose families move from place to place.\n\nThis bill would instead define a \"migrant agricultural worker family\" as a family with at least one individual who has earned at least 40% of their total gross income from employment in fishing, agriculture, or agriculturally related work during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of application for childcare and development services. For the purpose of enrollment in migrant child care and development programs, the bill would require the department to ensure that the self certification of income be consistent with other child care and development programs under the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
