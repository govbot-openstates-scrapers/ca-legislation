{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB671", "title": "Pedestrian crossing signals.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Pedestriancrossingsignals"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Under existing law, a pedestrian control signal showing a \"WALK\" or approved \"Walking Person\" symbol means a pedestrian may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal. Under existing law, a pedestrian facing a flashing \"DON'T WALK\" or \"WAIT\" or approved \"Upraised Hand\" symbol with a \"countdown\" signal, as specified, means a pedestrian may start crossing the roadway in the direction of the signal but requires the pedestrian to finish crossing prior to the display of the steady \"DON'T WALK\" or \"WAIT\" or approved \"Upraised Hand\" symbol, as specified.\n\nUpon the first placement or replacement of a traffic-actuated signal, as specified, existing law requires that traffic-actuated signal to be installed and maintained to detect bicycle or motorcycle traffic on the roadway. For these purposes, existing law defines a traffic-actuated signal as an official traffic signal, as specified, that displays one or more of its indications in response to traffic detected by mechanical, visual, electrical, or other means. Upon the first placement or replacement of a state-owned or -operated traffic-actuated signal, existing law requires that the traffic-actuated signal to be installed and maintained to have a leading pedestrian interval (LPI) and include the installation, activation, and maintenance of an accessible pedestrian signal (APS) and detector that complies with certain sections of the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD) .\n\nAt crosswalks with state-owned or -operated traffic-actuated signals and pedestrian hybrid beacons with pedestrian signal heads, this bill would require the walk indication and other visual signals to comply with CA MUTCD. The bill would require these pedestrian signal heads to have an APS pushbutton or touch-free APS that activates \"WALK\" or \"DON'T WALK\" intervals and other visual signals at signalized intersections in nonvisual formats. The bill would require touch-free APS to be installed at new signalized pedestrian crossings on capital projects on the state highway system, encroachment projects, and highway maintenance-funded projects, as specified. The bill would require, as soon as practicable, all existing state-owned or -operated traffic signals located in certain areas to be identified and recorded in the Department of Transportation management system (TMS) inventory database to assist future annual operational review requirements and coordination with local agencies for delegated signals. The bill would require LPIs to be implemented at these existing state-owned or -operated traffic signals locations at the next opportunity for regularly scheduled operational reviews. The bill would require local agencies to report the implementation of LPIs at locations where local agencies are operating state-owned traffic-actuated signals so these locations can be included in the TMS inventory database. By placing new requirements on local agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
