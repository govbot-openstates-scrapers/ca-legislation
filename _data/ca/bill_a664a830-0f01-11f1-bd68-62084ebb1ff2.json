Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires that health care service plan contracts and health insurance policies provide coverage for certain services and treatments, including emergency medical transportation services. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or a health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2020, to provide, among other things, that if an enrollee, insured, or subscriber receives covered services from a noncontracting air ambulance provider, the individual will pay no more than the same cost sharing that the individual would pay for the same covered services received from a contracting air ambulance provider, referred to as the in-network cost-sharing amount.\n\nThis bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
