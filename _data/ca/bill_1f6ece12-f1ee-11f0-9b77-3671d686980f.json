The amount of that contribution limit for an election occurring from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2026, inclusive, is $5,900.\n\nThis bill would apply that contribution limit and certain related provisions to candidates for judicial, school district, and community college district office. The bill would authorize the Judicial Council, school districts, and community college districts to impose more restrictive contribution limits on candidates for judicial, school district, and community college district office, respectively. The bill's provisions would become operative on January 1, 2027.\n\nAny person who knowingly or willfully violates the Political Reform Act of 1974 is guilty of a misdemeanor. By adding new contribution limits to the act, the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime and thereby impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Elections Code: interpretation."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
