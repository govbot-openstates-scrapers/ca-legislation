{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB140", "title": "State Bargaining Unit 6.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["StateBargainingUnit6"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law provides that a provision of a memorandum of understanding reached between the state employer and a recognized employee organization representing state civil service employees that requires the expenditure of funds does not become effective unless approved by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Human Resources to provide a memorandum of understanding to the Legislative Analyst, who then has 10 calendar days from the date the tentative agreement is received to issue a fiscal analysis to the Legislature. Existing law prohibits the memorandum of understanding from being subject to legislative determination until either the Legislative Analyst has presented a fiscal analysis of the memorandum of understanding or until 10 calendar days have elapsed since the memorandum was received by the Legislative Analyst.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding the above-described statutory provisions, would approve provisions of the agreement entered into by the state employer and State Bargaining Unit 6. The bill would provide that the provisions of the agreement that require the expenditure of funds will not take effect unless funds for these provisions are specifically appropriated by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the state employer or State Bargaining Unit 6 to reopen negotiations if funds for these provisions are not specifically appropriated by the Legislature. The bill would require the provisions of the agreement that require the expenditure of funds to become effective even if the provisions approved by the Legislature in legislation other than the annual Budget Act. By approving provisions of the agreement that require the expenditure of funds, this bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(2) Existing law, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment of compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by specified memoranda of understanding if the Budget Act of 2025 is not enacted by July 1, 2025. Existing law includes within these continuous appropriation provisions a memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6, effective July 3, 2023, to July 2, 2025, inclusive.\n\nThis bill would, instead, include the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6 that is effective July 3, 2025, to July 2, 2028, inclusive.\n\nExisting law, for the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment and compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by specified memoranda of understanding if the Budget Act of 2026 is not enacted by July 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would additionally include the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6 that is effective July 3, 2025, to July 2, 2028, inclusive.\n\nExisting law, for the 2027\u201328 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment and compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by specified memoranda of understanding if the Budget Act of 2027 is not enacted by July 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would additionally include the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6 that is effective July 3, 2025, to July 2, 2028, inclusive. The bill would also make technical changes by deleting provisions regarding specified memoranda of understanding from these provisions that expire before the commencement of the 2026\u201327 fiscal year.\n\nThis bill, for the 2028\u201329 fiscal year, if the Budget Act of 2028 is not enacted by July 1, 2028, with respect to the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6, as described above, would continuously appropriate to the Controller from the General Fund, unallocated special funds in the amount necessary for the payment of compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by this memorandum of understanding until the Budget Act of 2028 in enacted, subject to certain conditions.\n\n(3) Existing law states that it is the policy of the state that the workweek of the state employee shall be 40 hours, and the workday of state employees 8 hours, except that workweeks and workdays of a different number of hours may be established in order to meet the varying needs of the different state agencies. Notwithstanding that policy, existing law required a state employee, except as specified, to participate in the Personal Leave Program 2020 (PLP 2020 Program) , either as required by an applicable memorandum of understanding reached or by the direction of the department for excluded employees, under which each employee would receive a reduction in pay not greater than 10% in exchange for up to 16 hours of PLP 2020 Program leave credits per month.\n\nThis bill would require a state employee in Bargaining Unit 6, except as specified, for the period from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027, to participate in the Personal Leave Program 2025 (PLP 2025) , either as required by an applicable memorandum of understanding reached or by the direction of the department for excluded employees, under which each employee in Bargaining Unit 6 would receive a 3% reduction in pay in exchange for 5 hours of PLP 2025 leave credits on the first day of each monthly pay period, except as provided.\n\n(4) Existing law, the Public Employees' Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA) , which is administered by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System, prescribes methods for calculating the state employer contribution for postemployment health care benefits for eligible retired public employees and their families and for the vesting of these benefits. PEMHCA establishes the Annuitants' Health Care Coverage Fund, which is continuously appropriated, for the purpose of prefunding health care coverage for annuitants, including administrative costs.\n\nPEMHCA requires employees in State Bargaining Unit 6 to prefund retiree health care and the state to make a matching contribution. PEMHCA suspended the employees' monthly contribution for prefunding postemployment benefits for the 2020\u201321 fiscal year.\n\nThis bill would suspend the employer's monthly contribution for prefunding other postemployment benefits for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u20132027 fiscal years.\n\n(5) This bill would provide for the reduction of specified Budget Act of 2025 item appropriations pursuant to an agreement reached between the state employer and State Bargaining Unit 6 in accordance with a specified schedule.\n\n(6) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Sections 19829.9853, 19829.9854, 19829.9855, 19851, and 22944.5 of the Government Code proposed by AB 139, SB 139, or both, to be operative only if this bill and AB 139, SB 139, or both, are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(7) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
