Existing law authorizes the commission to adopt new, or expand existing, fixed charges, as defined, for the purpose of collecting a reasonable portion of the fixed costs of providing electrical service to residential customers. Under existing law, the commission may authorize fixed charges for any rate schedule applicable to a residential customer account. Existing law requires the commission, no later than July 1, 2024, to authorize a fixed charge for default residential rates on an income-graduated basis, as provided. Existing law requires increases to electrical rates and charges in rate design proceedings to be reasonable and subject to a reasonable phase-in schedule relative to the rates and charges in effect before January 1, 2014.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions relating to fixed charges and rate increases.\n\n(2) The Personal Income Tax Law authorizes various deductions in computing income that is subject to tax under that law.\n\nThis bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, would allow a deduction in computing adjusted gross income in connection with health savings accounts in modified conformity with federal law. In general, the deduction would be an amount equal to the aggregate amount paid in cash during the taxable year by, or on behalf of, an eligible individual, as defined, to a health savings account of that individual, as provided. The bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, would also provide related conformity to that federal law with respect to the allowance of rollovers from Archer Medical Savings Accounts, health flexible spending arrangements, or health reimbursement accounts to a health savings account, and penalties in connection therewith."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Taxes and fees."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
