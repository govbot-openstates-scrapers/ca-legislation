The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nUnder this bill, commencing on July 1, 2027, and subject to an appropriation, Medi-Cal fee-for-service reimbursement for nonemergency ambulance transportation services, as defined, would be in an amount equal to 80% of the amount set forth in the federal Medicare ambulance fee schedule for the corresponding level of service, adjusted by the Geographic Practice Cost Index, as specified. The bill would require the department to establish a Medi-Cal managed care directed payment program for nonemergency ambulance transportation services, with the reimbursement rates set in an amount equal to at least the amount set forth under fee-for-service reimbursement.\n\nThe bill would require the department to maximize federal financial participation in implementing the above-described provisions to the extent allowable. To the extent that federal financial participation is unavailable, the bill would require the department to implement the provisions using state funds, as specified.\n\nUnder the bill, whenever the medical necessity of nonemergency ambulance transportation services needs to be certified for purposes of Medi-Cal coverage, either a physician or a nonphysician authorized under certain federal regulations would be permitted to complete that certification, as specified. The bill would require the department to revise and update the Medi-Cal provider manual or any guidance, as applicable, to implement this provision.\n\nExisting Medi-Cal regulations require that records of medical transportation providers include, among other information, odometer readings at each pickup and delivery location.\n\nUnder this bill, for purposes of documenting mileage in their records under the Medi-Cal program, medical transportation providers would be authorized to utilize vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking, digital mapping software or applications, or another reasonable mechanism identified by the department, as specified, in addition to the above-described odometer readings. The bill would require the department to revise and update any corresponding regulations, including the above-described provision."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Medi-Cal reimbursements: nonemergency ambulance transportation."}, {"note": "", "title": "Medi-Cal reimbursements: ambulance transports."}, {"note": "", "title": "Medi-Cal reimbursements: nonemergency interfacility transfers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
