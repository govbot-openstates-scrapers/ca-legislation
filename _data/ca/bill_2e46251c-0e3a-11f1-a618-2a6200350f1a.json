Existing law limits the amount of on-sale general licenses that may be issued by the department based on the population of the county in which the licensed premises are located.\n\nThis bill would provide an exception to the limitation described above by authorizing the issuance of up to 10 additional new original on-sale general licenses for bona fide public eating places in the County of San Luis Obispo. The bill would prohibit the department from issuing more than 5 of these licenses per year. The bill would specify that a person holding a valid on-sale general license for seasonal business is not prohibited from applying for licenses to be issued pursuant to this authorization. The bill would prohibit transferring the new licenses out of the county or to premises that do not qualify under these provisions. The bill would also prohibit selling or transferring the new licenses for a price greater than the original fee paid by the seller or transferor.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of San Luis Obispo."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Department of Consumer Affairs: consumer complaints."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
