Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pupil health: epinephrine delivery systems: schoolsites and programs."}, {"note": "", "title": "Pupil health: epinephrine delivery systems: public schools and programs."}, {"note": "", "title": "Pupil health: epinephrine auto-injectors."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
