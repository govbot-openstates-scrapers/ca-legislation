{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1184", "title": "Common interest developments: association management and meeting procedures.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Commoninterestdevelopments", "associationmanagementandmeetingprocedures"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, governs the management and operation of common interest developments by an association. Existing law requires the board of an association to provide general notice of a proposed rule change at least 28 days before making the rule change, in accordance with certain procedures. Existing law, however, permits the board to make an emergency rule change if it determines that the change is required to address an imminent threat to public health or safety, or an imminent risk of substantial economic loss to the association, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require the general notice for an emergency rule change to include the text of the rule change, a description of its purpose and effect, and the date when the rule change will expire.\n\nExisting law, the Common Interest Development Open Meeting Act, prohibits the board of a common interest development from taking action on any item of business outside of a board meeting. Existing law also prohibits the board from conducting a meeting via a series of electronic transmissions, except in specified emergency circumstances.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a majority of the directors of the board, outside an authorized meeting, from using a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business within the board's subject matter jurisdiction, except in an emergency. The bill would also exempt from this prohibition certain informational and ministerial communications.\n\nExisting law authorizes the board to adjourn to, or meet solely in, executive session to consider litigation and other specified matters. Existing law requires any matter discussed in executive session to be generally noted in the minutes of the immediately following meeting that is open to the entire membership.\n\nThis bill would require the board, if the association becomes involved in litigation, to provide notice of the occurrence as part of the annual budget report distributed to members, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require, if open session meetings of the board are electronically recorded using audio, or audio and video, that the recordings be considered a record of the association and be made available to members on the same basis as written meeting minutes. The bill would require notice to be given at the beginning of every open session of the board that the meeting is being recorded.\n\nExisting law requires the minutes, minutes proposed for adoption that are marked to indicate draft status, or a summary of the minutes of a board meeting, other than an executive session, to be available to members within 30 days of the meeting and distributed to a member upon request and upon reimbursement of the association's cost for making that distribution.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the imposition of a charge for minutes that are distributed electronically. The bill would allow minutes posted on the association website to meet minute distribution requirements. The bill would require the minutes, or proposed minutes, to include specified information, including the date and time of the meeting.\n\nUnder existing law, the operating rules are a part of the governing documents of a common interest development. Existing law requires an amendment to the governing documents of the development, among other actions, to be held by secret ballot in accordance with specified procedures.\n\nThis bill would exclude an amendment to the operating rules from the requirement that the amendment be held by secret ballot. The bill would make various other related and conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing Accountability Act."}, {"note": "", "title": "Department of Housing and Community Development: annual report: Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention program."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
