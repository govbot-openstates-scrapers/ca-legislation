Existing law permits a voter using a vote by mail ballot to vote the ballot at the office of the elections official, including satellite locations, before the close of polls on election day. Existing law requires the elections official to provide notice of a satellite location by issuing a general news release no later than 14 days before voting at the satellite location may occur. Existing law requires a vote by mail ballot voted at a satellite location pursuant to the above provisions to be placed in a vote by mail voter identification envelope for processing, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would permit a voter using a vote by mail ballot, no later than 29 days before the day of an election, to vote the ballot at the office of the elections official or a satellite location. For a statewide election, if the county does not conduct an all-mailed ballot election, as specified, the bill would require the county to provide at least one early voting location on the Saturday before the day of the election that is open for at least 6 hours. The bill would require the early voting location to permit the voter to return their vote by mail ballot, register to vote, receive and vote a provisional ballot, and receive a replacement ballot, among other requirements. The bill would repeal the above requirement that the voter use a voter identification envelope when voting their vote by mail ballot at the satellite location. The bill would repeal the above requirement that the elections official issue a news release regarding satellite locations, and instead require the elections official to provide notice of a satellite location not later than two weeks before voting may occur at the satellite location.\n\nBy imposing new duties on local elections officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Replacement ballots."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
