Existing law specifies that a development is consistent with the objective planning standards if there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the development is consistent with the objective planning standards. Existing law prohibits a development subject to these provisions from being located on a hazardous waste site unless certain exceptions apply, including the State Department of Public Health, State Water Resources Control Board, or Department of Toxic Substances Control has otherwise cleared the site for residential use or residential mixed uses.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
