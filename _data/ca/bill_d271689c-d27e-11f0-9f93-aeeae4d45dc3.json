Existing law establishes requirements for the delivery of medical services, including via telehealth by specified health care providers. A violation of the act is a crime.\n\nUnder existing law, a \"health care provider,\" for purpose of the act, includes a qualified autism service provider or a qualified autism service professional that is certified by a national entity, as specified.\n\nThis bill would expand that definition of \"health care provider\" to also include a qualified autism service paraprofessional. By expanding the scope of a crime under the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
