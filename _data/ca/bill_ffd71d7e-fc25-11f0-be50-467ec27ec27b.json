Existing law also provides that all youth confined in juvenile facilities have specified rights, including, among others, the right to receive adequate personal hygiene items.\n\n This bill would require that indigent wards or detainees be provided basic hygiene products free of charge and require that those individuals have guaranteed access to hygiene products, upon their request. The bill would prohibit an indigent ward or detainee from being denied access to hygiene products as a disciplinary measure. The bill would prohibit debt from being accrued as a result of the provision of hygiene products to indigent wards or detainees and would require any debt accrued for the provision of hygiene products prior to January 1, 2026, to be discharged. By expanding the duties of probation officers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "County detention: commissary."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
