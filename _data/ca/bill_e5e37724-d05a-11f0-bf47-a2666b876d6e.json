Existing law requires a sealed box of tools, containing specified items, including one backpack pump-type fire extinguisher filled with water, to be located within the operating area and accessible in the event of a fire.\n\nThis bill would instead require a dedicated set of tools, as specified, including a sufficient number of fire extinguishers, to be located within the operating area and accessible in the event of a fire, so that, when added to any other tools on the industrial operation, each employee at the operation can be equipped to fight fire. The bill would make other nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
