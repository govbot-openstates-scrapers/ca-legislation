If it is projected that it is not feasible for the department to meet that requirement, the bill would require the department to publish on its internet website a written notice of which mountain passes it will not be able to open, including the documented causes, by April 1 of each year."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
