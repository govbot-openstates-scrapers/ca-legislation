The act requires the board to admit to examination for a license as a hairstylist to practice hairstyling a person who has made application to the board in proper form, paid the fee required by the act, and meets certain qualifications, including that the person completed a course in hairstyling from a school approved by the board.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions relating to the license as a hairstylist and would make conforming changes.\n\nThe act also includes in the practice of barbering certain practices, including shampooing, arranging, dressing, curling, and waving and also the practice of hairstyling of all textures of hair by standard methods that are current at the time of the hairstyling. The act includes in the practice of cosmetology certain practices, including arranging, dressing, curling, waving, cleansing, shampooing, beautifying, or otherwise treating the hair of a person.\n\nThis bill would remove the practices described above from inclusion in the practices of barbering and cosmetology, respectively. The bill would require a person who engages in the practices of arranging, beautifying, cleansing, curling, dressing, shampooing, or waving the hair of a person at an establishment to provide notice to consumers of the person's licensure status. By expanding the scope of the crime of violating the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Business and Professions Code."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
