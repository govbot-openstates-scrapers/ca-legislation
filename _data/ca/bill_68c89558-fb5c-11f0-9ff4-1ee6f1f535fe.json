Existing law requires a party making initial disclosures of persons or records to additionally disclose persons or records that are relevant to the subject matter of the action, except as specified, and to disclose information and records regarding insurance policies or contracts that would make a person or insurance company liable to satisfy a judgment. Existing law requires initial disclosures to be verified via the written declaration of the party or the party's authorized representative, or signed by the party's counsel. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2027, and replaces them with prior law requiring initial disclosures to be made upon order of the court following the stipulation of the parties.\n\nThis bill would remove the January 1, 2027 repeal date, thereby indefinitely extending the operation of the provisions described above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
