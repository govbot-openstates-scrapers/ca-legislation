The act and other existing laws set forth the duties and authority of the office and the director, with respect to specified emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response activities within the state.\n\nThis bill would require the office, in collaboration with host counties, host committees, and partners, to prepare for the planning, resourcing, management, and delivery of safety and security at the mega sporting events and official watch parties, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup games, Super Bowl LXI 2027, the Summer Olympic Games 2028, and the Paralympic Games 2028. The bill would require the office to, among other things, consider ways to increase safety around and reduce the risk of, among other things, human trafficking at the mega sporting events. The bill would require the office to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the counties hosting the mega sporting events to implement the safety and security activities mentioned above. By imposing new duties on local governmental entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Crimes: human trafficking."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
