A first violation of this prohibition is punishable as a misdemeanor. Under existing law, if a person is convicted of a DUI violation and the offense occurs within 10 years of one or 2 separate DUI violations that resulted in specified convictions, the offense is also punishable as a misdemeanor, as specified, with escalating fines, suspensions, and other sanctions. Under existing law, if a person is convicted of a DUI violation and the offense occurs within 10 years of 3 or more separate DUI violations that resulted in specified convictions, the offense is punishable either as a misdemeanor or as a felony.\n\nThis bill would make a conviction of a DUI violation with the offense occurring within 10 years of one or 2 separate DUI violations that resulted in specified convictions also punishable either as a misdemeanor or as a felony. By increasing the punishment for a crime, the bill imposes a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
