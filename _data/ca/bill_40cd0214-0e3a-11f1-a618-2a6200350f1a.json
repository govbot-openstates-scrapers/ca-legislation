This bill would recast the requirements of the certificate to require a practitioner, licensed in this state in same discipline as the defendant or cross-defendant, not the attorney, to complete the certificate. The bill would specify required elements of the certificate pertaining to the licensure and experience of the practitioner, their lack of interest in the litigation, and their professional opinion regarding the reasonableness and merit of the action. The bill would remove the exception that an attorney can file a certification that states they were unable to obtain a consultation with a practitioner. The bill would make additional conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
