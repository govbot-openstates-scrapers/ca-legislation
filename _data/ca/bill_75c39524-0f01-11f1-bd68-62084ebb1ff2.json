If any change occurs in the information contained in a lobbyist certification, or if a lobbyist terminates all activity that required certification, existing law requires the lobbyist to submit an amended certification or notice of termination to the lobbyist's lobbying firm or lobbyist employer for filing with the Secretary of State within specified timelines.\n\nThis bill would instead require the lobbyist to submit the amended certification or notice of termination directly to the Secretary of State.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
