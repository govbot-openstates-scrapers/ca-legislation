The bill would authorize a city, county, or city and county to adopt a regulation, ordinance, or resolution imposing charges equal to its administrative costs relating to the removal, seizure, and storage costs of the vehicle, as provided. The bill would require an agency to release a seized vehicle to the owner, violator, or their agent after a minimum of 48 hours if certain conditions are met, including that the costs of removal, seizure, and storage have been paid. The bill would in certain circumstances authorize an agency to require, as a condition of release, proof that the violator has completed an electric bicycle safety and training program or a related local bicycle safety course, as described."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
