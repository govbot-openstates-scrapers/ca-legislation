Among other things, these provisions set forth the rights of residents and homeowners regarding the use of the property.\n\nExisting law exempts the rental of certain mobilehome spaces by a homeowner, if the mobilehome space is not the principal residence of the homeowner and the homeowner has not rented the mobilehome to another party, from any ordinance, rule, regulation, or initiative measure adopted by any city, county, or city and county, that establishes a maximum amount that the landlord may charge a tenant for rent, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, instead, apply that exemption to the rental of a mobilehome space that is not occupied as the actual residence of the homeowner or a tenant for a period of at least 30 consecutive days, except as specified.\n\nExisting law provides that, for purposes of the above provisions, a mobilehome is deemed to be the principal residence of the homeowner unless a review of state or county records demonstrate otherwise, as specified, and establishes procedures for the modification of rent or other terms of tenancy as a result of that review, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, instead, provide that before modifying the rent or other terms of tenancy as a result of learning that the mobilehome space is not occupied as described above, the management shall notify the homeowner, as specified.\n\nExisting law makes certain rental agreements exempt from the above provisions.\n\nThis bill would limit those exemptions to mobilehomes that are actively held available for sale, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
