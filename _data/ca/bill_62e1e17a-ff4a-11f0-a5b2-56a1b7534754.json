The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law requires the department, subject to any necessary federal approvals and the availability of federal financial participation, to make Medi-Cal payments to designated public hospitals (DPHs) and their affiliated government entities, as defined, in recognition of the Medi-Cal managed care share of graduate medical education (GME) costs. Existing law requires that the payments consist of direct and indirect GME payments made in recognition and support of the direct costs incurred in the operation of GME programs and the increased operating and patient care costs associated with teaching programs, respectively.\n\n Under existing law, the nonfederal share of these payments consists of voluntary intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) of funds provided by DPHs or their affiliated government entities, or other eligible public entities, as specified. Under existing law, the continuously appropriated DPH GME Special Fund is established for these purposes.\n\nThis bill would require the department, subject to any necessary federal approvals and the availability of federal financial participation, to make additional Medi-Cal payments to district and municipal public hospitals (DMPHs) , defined as nondesignated public hospitals, and to their affiliated government entities, in recognition of the Medi-Cal managed care share of GME costs. Under the bill, these payments would be made in a manner consistent with the methodology for GME payments to DPHs and their affiliated government entities and would consist of the above-described direct and indirect GME payment components. The bill would authorize the department to seek federal approval for other forms of GME payments to DMPHs and their affiliated government entities, as specified.\n\nUnder the bill, the nonfederal share of payments under these provisions would consist of voluntary IGTs of funds provided by DMPHs or their affiliated government entities, or other eligible public entities, to the extent permitted under certain federal regulations and other applicable federal Medicaid laws, and with no state General Fund moneys being used to fund the nonfederal share of payments. The bill would establish the DMPH GME Special Fund, with moneys deposited being continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of these provisions.\n\nThe bill would require the department to seek any necessary federal approvals for GME payments, effective no sooner than January 1, 2026. The bill would authorize the Director of Health Care Services to modify the requirements set forth in these provisions to the extent necessary to meet federal requirements or to maximize federal financial participation, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
