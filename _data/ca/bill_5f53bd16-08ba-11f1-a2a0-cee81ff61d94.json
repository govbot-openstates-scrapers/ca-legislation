If changes or alterations to precinct boundaries are made, existing law requires the elections official to prepare new maps or exterior descriptions. Existing law provides that precinct boundary changes occurring less than 125 days before an election are not effective for purposes of that election.\n\nThis bill would require the registrar of voters in each county to make available, upon request by any member of the public, a map in digital form provided free of charge that shows the effective boundaries of each precinct within the county.\n\nBy imposing new duties on local officials with respect to elections, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
