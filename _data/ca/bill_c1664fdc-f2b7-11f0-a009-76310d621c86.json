Existing law authorizes a pharmacist to, among other things, perform certain procedures or functions and furnish specified drugs.\n\nThis bill would authorize a pharmacist to furnish up to a 30-day supply of a prescription drug for a life-threatening condition if the pharmacy, or another pharmacy under common control with the pharmacy, has previously furnished that drug to the patient and the patient is unable to secure a new prescription for the drug before their supply is exhausted.
