Existing law requires, as part of the joint transition planning policy, the county office of education to assign transition oversight responsibilities to existing county office of education personnel who will work in collaboration with the county probation department and relevant local educational agencies to ensure that specified transition activities are completed for the pupil.\n\nThis bill would require, as part of the joint transition planning policy, the school district in the juvenile court school pupil's community to assign transition liaison responsibilities to a school district staff member, and notify the county office of education and the county probation department of the member's name and contact information. The bill would also require that staff member to work in collaboration with the county office of education transition oversight personnel throughout the calendar year to ensure that the transition activities noted above are completed for the pupil.\n\nExisting law requires, for pupils detained for 20 consecutive schooldays or fewer, the pupil's individualized learning plan, if one exists, to be made available by the county office of education to the pupil upon the pupil's release.\n\nThis bill would additionally require that pupil's individualized learning plan to be made available to the pupil's school district transition liaison personnel.\n\nExisting law requires the county office of education, in collaboration with the county probation department, to establish procedures for the timely, accurate, complete, and confidential transfer of educational records, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the county office of education to collaborate with relevant local educational agencies to establish those procedures.\n\n(2) Existing law requires local educational agencies to issue full or partial credit on an official transcript for all full or partial coursework satisfactorily completed by pupil in foster care, a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, a former juvenile court school pupil, a pupil who is a child of a military family, a pupil who is a migratory child, or a newcomer pupil, while attending a public school, juvenile court school, charter school, school in a country other than the United States, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the transferring local educational agency to issue that official transcript within 20 school days from the date of the pupil's transfer. The bill would prohibit partial credits for one course from equaling more than the number of credits the pupil would receive for completing the whole course at one location.\n\nBy imposing additional requirements on local educational entities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
