Existing law prohibits the operation of an autonomous vehicle on public roads until the manufacturer submits an application to the Department of Motor Vehicles, as specified, and that application is approved. Existing law requires that the application contain, at a minimum, specified certifications, including a certification by the manufacturer that the autonomous technology satisfies specified requirements, including that the autonomous vehicle has a separate mechanism to capture and store the autonomous technology sensor data for at least 30 seconds before a collision occurs between the autonomous vehicle and another vehicle, object, or person while operating in autonomous mode. Existing law requires the department to hold public hearings on the adoption of regulations applicable to the operation of an autonomous vehicle without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle.\n\nThis bill would, instead, require the separate mechanism to capture and store autonomous technology sensor data for at least 45 seconds before and after, whenever feasible, a collision. This bill would allow the department to hold public hearings on the adoption of the above regulations both online and in person."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
