{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1581", "title": "Pupils: data reporting: American Indian and Alaska Native pupils.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["AmericanIndianandAlaskaNativepupils", "Pupils", "datareporting"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) , which is maintained by the State Department of Education and consists of pupil data from elementary and secondary schools, as specified, relating to demographic, program participation, enrollment, and statewide assessments, among other things. Existing law requires the system to be used to accomplish specified goals, including to provide school districts and the department access to data, including demographic data, necessary to comply with federal reporting requirements.\n\nThis bill would require the department to, beginning with the 2027\u201328 school year, require, as part of CALPADS, a record of the tribal affiliation of each pupil new to a school district, county office of education, or charter school who identifies as American Indian or Alaska Native, as provided. The bill would require a school district, county office of education, or charter school to, on or before July 1, 2027, collect and report in CALPADS the tribal affiliation of each pupil enrolled in the 2026\u201327 school year who identifies as American Indian or Alaska Native, as provided. The bill would require the department to provide technical assistance to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools in implementing these provisions. To the extent this bill imposes additional duties on local educational agencies in collecting and reporting additional data through CALPADS, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
