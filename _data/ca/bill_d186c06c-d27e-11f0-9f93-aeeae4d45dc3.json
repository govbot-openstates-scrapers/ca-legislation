The act authorizes the state board to include in its regulation of those emissions the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Pursuant to the act, the state board has adopted the California Greenhouse Gas Cap-and-Trade Program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by applying a greenhouse gas allowance budget to specified entities and providing a trading mechanism for achieving compliance, as provided. The act requires the state board to adopt rules and regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that the statewide greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to at least 40% below the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, no later than December 31, 2030. Pursuant to the act, the state board has adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in California, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the state board from adopting any standard, regulation, or rule that affects the Low Carbon Fuel Standard or the California Greenhouse Gas Cap-and-Trade Program until the Legislative Analyst has analyzed the cost to the consumer of the proposed standard, regulation, or rule, as specified, and submitted its analysis to the Legislature."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
