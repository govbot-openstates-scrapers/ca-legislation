Existing law provides that an FFA, which contracts with a public entity for the provision of foster youth services, may be held liable for injury or damage caused by the FFA's negligence but not for the injury or damage caused by the public entity. Existing law requires the FFA and the public entity to each bear the cost of insuring against their respective acts and omissions and defending against claims arising from those risks. Existing law prohibits the above provisions from being waived or suspended by a court, and specifies that certain indemnification provisions in contracts between FFAs and public entities are void as against public policy and unenforceable. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would instead repeal those provisions on January 1, 2030."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
