Existing law requires elections officials to prepare a certified statement of the results of the election within 30 days of the election and to send the Secretary of State a complete copy of all election results within 31 days of the election. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prepare, certify, and file a statement of the vote no later than the 38th day after the election.\n\nThis bill would reduce those deadlines to 10 days for counting all ballots and preparing the certified statement of the results of the election, and 11 days for sending the Secretary of State a complete copy of all election results. The bill would require the Secretary of State to prepare, certify, and file a statement of the vote no later than 2 days after receiving election results from all county elections officials. By increasing the duties of county elections officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
