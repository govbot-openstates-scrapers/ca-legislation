Existing law entitles a student to resident classification for the purpose of determining tuition and fees if the student is a member, or a natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member, of the Armed Forces of the United States stationed in the state on active duty, except as specified.\n\nExisting law prohibits a student who is attending, or has been admitted to, a public postsecondary educational institution from losing their resident classification if they are continuously enrolled at that institution and a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, even if that member is (1) thereafter transferred on military orders to a place outside this state where the member continues to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States, or (2) thereafter retired as an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThis bill would extend the prohibition against losing resident classification to those same student dependents of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who are granted the right to reenroll even if the member of the Armed Forces has been transferred out of state or has retired from active duty."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
