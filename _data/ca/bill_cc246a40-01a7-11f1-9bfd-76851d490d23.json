Existing law requires that a method be provided for employees who have completed the training to save electronically and print a certificate of completion.\n\nExisting law requires that an employee who has received training in compliance with these provisions within the prior 2 years either from a current or a prior employer be given, and be required to read and acknowledge receipt of, the employer's antiharassment policy within 6 months of assuming the employee's new position and requires that the employee then be put on a 2-year tracking schedule based on the employee's last training. Existing law places the burden of establishing that the prior training was legally compliant with these provisions upon the employer.\n\nThis bill would authorize an employer to satisfy the training requirements by demonstrating that the employee possesses a certificate of completion within the past 2 years."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
