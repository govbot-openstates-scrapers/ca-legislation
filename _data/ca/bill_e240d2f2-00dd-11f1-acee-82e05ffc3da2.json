The bill would prohibit an electrical corporation or a local publicly owned electric utility from requiring a customer using a portable solar generation device to take specified actions, including, among other things, paying any fee or charge related to the device or the electricity the device feeds into a building's electrical system. The bill would provide that an electrical corporation or a local publicly owned electric utility is not liable for any damage or injury caused by a portable solar generation device.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nAdditionally, by imposing new duties on local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
