The bill would set forth the contents of the affidavit, the timeline and manner of submission, and reporting requirements. The bill would require an unspecified department to create a public, digital platform by January 3, 2028, that would make available affidavits and reports made pursuant to the bill and disaggregated data, as described. By requiring an affidavit, and thus expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
