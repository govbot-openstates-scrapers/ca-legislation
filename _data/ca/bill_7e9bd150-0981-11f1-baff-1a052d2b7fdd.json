Existing law requires any state bond measure approved on or after January 1, 2004, to be subject to an annual reporting process, with the head of the lead state agency administering the bond proceeds reporting certain information about the projects being funded to the Legislature and the Department of Finance. Existing law allows this information to be provided on the agency's internet website or the state's open data portal under certain circumstances. \n\nThis bill would require a bond act for any state general obligation bond measure that is approved by voters on and after January 1, 2026, to include specified information about the objectives of the bond expenditure and related data. The bill would also require the head of the lead state agency administering the bond to post on its internet website a notification that contains, among other information, details about the programs and projects authorized to be funded by the bond. The bill would further require each state agency subject to these provisions to provide a written report to the Department of Finance, the Legislative Analyst, and specified legislative committees that contains certain information regarding the general obligation bond, in accordance with the above-described provision allowing this information to be provided on the agency's internet website or the state's online data portal. The bill would require the report to include, among other information, whether the project, grant, or other expenditure of bond proceeds has been done in a timely manner."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public bodies: general obligation bonds: disclosure requirements."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
