Existing law establishes independent redistricting commissions in the Counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Fresno, and Sacramento, which are charged with adjusting the supervisorial district boundaries for their respective counties.\n\nThis bill would similarly establish the Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Merced, which would be charged with adjusting the boundary lines of the districts of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Merced in accordance with specified criteria. The commission would consist of 11 members who meet specified qualifications. By increasing the duties of local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Merced.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Fair elections."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
