Existing law requires a licensing authority to issue or renew a license for a person to carry a concealed firearm if specified conditions are met, including, among others, that the applicant is not a disqualified person for the license, as specified, and the applicant is the recorded owner of the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law deems an applicant to be a disqualified person and cannot receive or renew a license if, among other reasons, the applicant is reasonably likely to be a danger to self, others, or the community at large, or, in the 10 years prior to the licensing authority receiving the completed application, the applicant has been charged with any certain offense that was dismissed pursuant to a plea or dismissed with a waiver, as specified. Under existing law, any person who files an application knowing that any statement in the application is false is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would also treat the spouse of the recorded owner of the firearm as the recorded owner for licensing purposes. The bill would include additional specified acts that would deem an applicant as a disqualified person, including providing any information that the applicant knew or should have known was inaccurate or incomplete information in connection with the application or, in the 10 years prior to the licensing authority receiving the completed application for a new license or a license renewal, the applicant has been convicted of certain offenses, including knowingly and willingly threatening the life of any elected public official and other specified persons. By expanding the application of an existing crime and expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would make other conforming changes.\n\nThe bill would make these provisions severable.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
