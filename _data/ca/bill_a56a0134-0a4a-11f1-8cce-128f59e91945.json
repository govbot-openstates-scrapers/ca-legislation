Under existing law, those grants are aimed at obtaining certain immigration remedies and benefits, assisting with the naturalization process and an appeal arising from the process, or providing legal training and technical assistance. Existing law prohibits these funds from being used to provide legal services to an individual who has been convicted of, or who is currently appealing a conviction for, a violent felony, as specified, or a serious felony, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally prohibit these funds from being used to obstruct or interfere with federal enforcement actions or legal proceedings against individuals convicted of a felony who are present in the United States in violation of federal immigration laws. The bill would specify that this restriction includes, but is not limited to, expenditures on litigation, administrative actions, or any other measures intended to shield such individuals from federal apprehension or deportation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
