The act prohibits a person from engaging in the practice of nursing without an active license but authorizes a student to render nursing services incidental to the student's course of study, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize a student to render nursing services if the student is a resident of the state and enrolled in a prelicensure distance education nursing program based at an out-of-state private postsecondary educational institution, as defined, for the purpose of gaining clinical experience in a clinical setting that meets certain criteria, including that the program is accredited by a programmatic accreditation entity recognized by the United States Department of Education and that the program maintains minimum faculty to student ratios required of board-approved programs for inperson clinical experiences. The bill would require the student to be supervised in person by a registered nurse licensed by the board while rendering nursing services. The bill would prohibit a clinical agency or facility from offering clinical experience placements to an out-of-state private postsecondary educational institution if the placements are needed to fulfill the clinical experience requirements of in-state students enrolled in a board-approved nursing program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
