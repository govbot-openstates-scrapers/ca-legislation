Under the act, the California Coastal Commission generally has primary responsibility for the implementation of the act and is designated as the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes, and is authorized to exercise any and all powers set forth in the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 or any other federal act that relates to the planning or management of the coastal zone.\n\nExisting federal law requires federal agency activity within or outside the coastal zone that affects any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone to be carried out in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of approved state management programs, as defined. Existing federal law requires a consistency determination to contain specified information and outlines the process that follows a state agency objection to a federal agency's consistency determination.\n\nThis bill would deem the commission's objection to concurrence on Consistency Determination CD-0007-24 null and void. The bill would deem the activities at Vandenberg Space Force Base, outlined by Consistency Determination CD-0007-24, consistent with the objectives of the California Coastal Act of 1976. The bill would provide that it shall act as a concurrence regarding consistency with the California Coastal Act of 1976.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Vandenberg Space Force Base.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
