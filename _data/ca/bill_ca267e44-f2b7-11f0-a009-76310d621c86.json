Existing law defines a \"transitional housing placement provider\" to mean an organization licensed by the department to provide transitional housing to foster children who are at least 16 years of age. A violation of the act is a misdemeanor.\n\nExisting law defines \"Transitional Housing Program-Plus\" to mean a provider certified by the applicable county to provide transitional housing services to former foster youth who have exited the foster care system on or after their 18th birthday. Existing law exempts Transitional Housing Program-Plus providers from licensure under the California Community Care Facilities Act if they are certified and have obtained a local fire clearance.\n\nThis bill would require a contract for a transitional housing placement provider or a Transitional Housing Program-Plus provider to have an initial term of 3 years. The bill would authorize a contract to be renewed for 2 additional 1-year terms. If a contract has been renewed for 2 additional 1-year terms, the bill would authorize a contract to be renewed for additional 10-year terms. The bill would authorize the county to terminate a contract or a portion of the contracted services prior to the end of the contract term by providing at least 90 days' notice to the contractor. By imposing new duties on counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
