The office serves as the State Disaster Council for the purposes of the California Disaster and Civil Defense Master Mutual Aid Agreement. Existing law states it is the purpose of the Legislature to facilitate the rendering of aid to areas stricken by an emergency and to make unnecessary the execution of written agreements customarily entered into by public agencies exercising joint powers, and that emergency plans duly adopted and approved as provided by the Governor shall be effective as satisfying the requirement for mutual aid operational plans provided in the Master Mutual Aid Agreement. Existing law requires outside aid be rendered in accordance with approved emergency plans during any state of war emergency or state of emergency when the need arises in any county, city and county, or city.\n\nThis bill would additionally state that it is the purpose of the Legislature to facilitate the rendering of public works resources critical for disaster response and recovery to areas stricken by an emergency. The bill would require that outside aid rendered during any state of war emergency or state of emergency includes public works personnel, equipment, and materials. The bill would also require the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with relevant local and state public works agencies, to develop and adopt a Public Works Emergency Mutual Aid Plan to ensure the systematic and efficient mobilization of public works resources during emergencies. By imposing requirements on public works agencies, which includes local public works agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
