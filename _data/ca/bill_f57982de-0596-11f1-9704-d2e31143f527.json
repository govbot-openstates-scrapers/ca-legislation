Existing law sets forth other timely access requirements for health care service plans and health insurers, including with regard to referrals to a specialist.\n\nExisting law establishes various health professions development programs, within the Department of Health Care Access and Information, for the promotion of education, training, and recruitment of health professionals to address workforce shortage and distribution needs. Existing law sets forth various provisions for the authorized use of telehealth in the delivery of health care services.\n\nThis bill would, subject to an appropriation, require the California Health and Human Services Agency, in collaboration with the Department of Health Care Access and Information and the State Department of Health Care Services, to establish a demonstration project for a grant program. Under the bill, the grant program would be aimed at facilitating a telehealth and other virtual services specialty care network or networks that are designed to serve patients of safety-net providers consisting of qualifying providers, as defined.\n\nUnder the bill, the purpose of the demonstration project would be to improve access to specialty care for Medi-Cal beneficiaries through development of a financially sustainable specialty care network or networks that are focused on serving the needs of the health care safety net. The bill would authorize the focus of the project to include increasing access to behavioral and maternal health services and additional specialties prioritized by the agency. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that implementation of the demonstration project would facilitate compliance with any applicable network adequacy standards.\n\nThe bill would require the agency to administer the grant program to award grant funds to one or more grantees based on an application process and by meeting specified conditions. The bill would require a grantee to use the funds to develop a network or networks by, among other things, providing health information technology and technical assistance to support both the specialists and any primary care provider care coordination, referral, or electronic consultations.\n\nThe bill would require the agency to arrange an independent evaluation of the demonstration project. The bill would require the evaluation to examine the extent to which the project was successful in achieving certain objectives, including, among others, reducing structural barriers to access experienced by patients. The bill would require a grantee to report data and information to allow for monitoring and evaluation of the project. The bill would require the agency to ensure that lessons learned, recommendations, and best practices from the project are publicly disseminated to inform the development of a telehealth and specialty care network or networks to serve the needs of the health care safety net."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Specialty care network: telehealth and other virtual services."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
