Existing law makes it a crime for a person authorized to receive state summary criminal history information to knowingly furnish that information to a person who is not authorized to receive it.\n\nThe bill would require the Attorney General to furnish state summary criminal history information to a city attorney or county counsel pursuing a public nuisance action or red light abatement action, as provided. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
