Under existing law, school districts that receive local revenues that exceed the LCFF amount do not receive a specified apportionment of LCFF funds, as provided, and are known as \"basic aid school districts\" or \"excess tax entities.\"\n\nThe Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act, an initiative approved by the voters as Proposition 98 at the November 8, 1988, statewide general election, amended the California Constitution to, among other things, set forth a formula for computing the minimum amount of revenues that the state is required to appropriate for the support of school districts and community college districts in any given fiscal year.\n\nThe California Constitution creates the Public School System Stabilization Account in the General Fund and requires the Controller to transfer, pursuant to a schedule provided by the Director of Finance, a specified amount from the General Fund to the account in each fiscal year, except as provided.\n\nThe California Constitution generally prohibits the total annual appropriations subject to limitation of the state and each local government from exceeding the appropriations limit of the entity of government for the prior fiscal year, adjusted for the change in the cost of living and the change in population. The California Constitution defines \"appropriations subject to limitation\" for these purposes.\n\nThis bill would establish the Equalization Reserve Account in the General Fund. The bill would require interest earned on funds in the account to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to increase per-pupil funding in non-basic aid school districts, defined as school districts that received the above-described apportionment of LCFF funds in any of the then preceding 3 fiscal years, in a manner prescribed by the Legislature. The bill would require the Controller, in any fiscal year in which there is an increase over the preceding fiscal year in the minimum amount of revenues the state is required to appropriate for the support of school districts and community college districts, to transfer from the General Fund to the Equalization Reserve Account an amount equal to the total amount transferred from the General Fund to the Public School System Stabilization Account in that fiscal year, as provided. \n\nThese provisions would become operative only if a constitutional amendment, approved by the voters, (1) excludes funds transferred to or allocated from the account from computations of the minimum amount of revenues that the state is required to appropriate for the support of school districts and community college districts, from the moneys allocated for purposes of meeting that minimum funding obligation, and from the total annual state appropriations subject to the limitation described above, and (2) requires the Legislature, in each fiscal year, to allocate a percentage of the interest that has been deposited in the account to increase per-pupil funding in non-basic aid school districts."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and Zoning Law: workforce housing: teachers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
