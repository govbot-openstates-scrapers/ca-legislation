The bill would require the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to administer the tax pursuant to the Fee Collection Procedures Law, the violation of which is a crime. By extending the application of the Fee Collection Procedures Law, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would create the Social Media Safety Trust Fund within the State Treasury and would require all moneys raised pursuant to these taxes be deposited into the fund. The bill would establish various accounts within the fund and would allocate moneys into those accounts for expenditure according to specified purposes, including an Education Account, Mental Health Care Account, Research and Development Account, and Social Services Account. The bill would continuously appropriate the moneys in the fund to administer those provisions.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
