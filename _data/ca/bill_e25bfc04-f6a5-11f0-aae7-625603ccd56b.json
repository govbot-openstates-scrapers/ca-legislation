The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law establishes a schedule of benefits under the Medi-Cal program and provides for various services, including behavioral and mental health services that are rendered by Medi-Cal enrolled providers.\n\nExisting law authorizes a county, or an agency representing the county, to develop a peer support specialist certification program, subject to department approval. Existing law imposes specified requirements on applicants for certification as a peer support specialist, including that the applicant be at least 18 years of age and possess a high school diploma or equivalent degree.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement of possessing a high school diploma or equivalent degree from the requirements necessary for an applicant to receive certification."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Community health workers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
