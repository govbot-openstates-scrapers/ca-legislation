Existing law, applicable to Sonoma County and Imperial County, authorizes the board of retirement, with approval of the county board of supervisors, to grant a cost-of-living adjustment on a prefunded basis to the retirement allowances, optional death allowances, or annual death allowances payable to or on account of eligible members.\n\nThis bill would permit the county board of supervisors for Sonoma County to authorize a cost-of-living adjustment to the retirement allowances, optional death allowances, or annual death allowances payable by the retirement system. Before authorizing a cost-of-living adjustment, the bill would require the county board of supervisors to take various actions, including collaborating with the retirement board to identify the eligible retired members, survivors, beneficiaries, or successors in interest designated, or a subset of those benefit recipients, to receive the cost-of-living adjustment, the amount thereof, and the funding source.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Sonoma County."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
