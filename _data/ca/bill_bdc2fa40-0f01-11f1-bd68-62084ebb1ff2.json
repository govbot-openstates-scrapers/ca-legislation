The bill would require these contracts to be paid for with money from the county or school district's general fund, a local construction bond, or federal or state funds and to be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2030, a school district or county office of education that uses the task order procurement contracting method to submit to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature a report on its use of the task order procurement contracting method, as specified.\n\nThis bill would limit the scope of these contracts to those purposes authorized by its funding source. The bill would also require the contracting educational agency to ensure that it is in compliance with existing provisions that authorize personal service contracting for services currently or customarily performed by classified school employees before entering into a contract pursuant to this bill."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
