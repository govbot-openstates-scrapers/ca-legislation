Existing law requires the department to provide by regulation for the qualification and disqualification of design approval agencies to perform approval of factory-built housing plans and specifications and makes approval by these agencies the equivalent of department approval. The law provides that any person who violates any of these provisions and other specified law is guilty of a misdemeanor, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require plans or specifications of factory-built housing approved pursuant to these provisions to be approved by unit serial number and would authorize the approved plans or specifications to be used in subsequent development projects unless building standards relating to factory-built housing are modified, as specified. The bill would require the department and the design approval agencies to limit their review to the portions of a plan or specification that has not already received approval, as specified. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
