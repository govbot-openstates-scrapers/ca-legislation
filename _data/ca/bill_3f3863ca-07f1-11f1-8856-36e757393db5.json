The act requires the manufacturer of a beverage sold in a plastic beverage container subject to the California Redemption Value to report to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery certain information about the amounts of virgin plastic and postconsumer recycled plastic used for plastic beverage containers subject to the California Redemption Value for sale in the state in the previous calendar year. Existing law requires the department to post this reported information on its internet website, as provided. Existing law provides that a violation of the act or a regulation adopted pursuant to the act is a crime.\n\nThis bill, beginning on or before March 1, 2027, would require a manufacturer of a beverage sold in a plastic beverage container subject to the California Redemption Value to also report to the department by country of origin the amount in pounds of imported postconsumer recycled plastic used for plastic beverage containers subject to the California Redemption Value for sale in the state in the previous calendar year and to provide proof that the postconsumer recycled content used by the manufacturer for plastic beverage containers has been validated by a third party, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to post on its internet website the reported amounts of imported postconsumer recycled plastic used for plastic beverage containers in an aggregated form and would exempt the unaggregated amounts reported to the department from disclosure under the California Public Records Act.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
