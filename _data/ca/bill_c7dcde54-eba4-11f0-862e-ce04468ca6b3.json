For purposes of the transfer of a family home, that law requires the transfer to be of a principal residence of the transferor and to become the principal residence of the transferee within one year of the transfer. That law also requires the transferee to file for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption within a year of the transfer, as described.\n\nThis bill would provide that, in the event of the death of an eligible transferor, the transfer commencing either of the above-described one-year periods shall be deemed to occur as of the effective date of a court's determination of the final ownership of the property, as specified. The bill would require a transferee to notify the assessor of the county in which the property is located of their intention to claim the exclusion, as specified. By expanding the duties of local tax officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property tax: tax-defaulted property sales: sales to public agencies."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
