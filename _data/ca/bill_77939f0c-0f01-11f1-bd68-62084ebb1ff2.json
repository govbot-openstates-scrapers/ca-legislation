Existing law requires the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature on progress made in the prior calendar year toward achieving the 30x30 goal. Existing law requires the report to include specified information, including identified barriers to implementing the 30x30 goal and recommended actions taken or needed to address those barriers.\n\nThis bill would require the report to include sufficient information to accurately quantify and identify the acreage reported to be newly conserved and distinguish it from acreage previously reported as conserved. The bill would require the secretary to post the report on the Natural Resources Agency's internet website where it is publicly accessible."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
