Existing law requires a generator of hazardous waste to pay to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration a generation and handling fee for each generator site, and requires the Board of Environmental Safety to establish a schedule of rates for the fee, as provided. A violation of the hazardous waste control laws is a crime.\n\nExisting law generally exempts geothermal waste that is generated from the exploration, development, or production of geothermal energy and that does not result from drilling for geothermal resources from the hazardous waste control laws. Existing law limits that exemption under various circumstances, including, among other circumstances, when the waste is no longer contained in a piping system, nonearthen trench, or other specified form of containment, or is left in a lined surface impoundment 18 months after the date the surface impoundment has last received waste.\n\nThis bill would limit the generation and handling fee rate for geothermal waste that is not exempt from the hazardous waste control laws to no more than $10 per ton."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Board of Environmental Safety: annual review."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
