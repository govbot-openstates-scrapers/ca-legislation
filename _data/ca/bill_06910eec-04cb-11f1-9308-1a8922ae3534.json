The bill would prohibit a claim for qualified pet adoption costs for more than one qualified pet, as defined, during the life of the taxpayer. The bill would additionally prohibit a claim for qualified pet medical expenses with regard to more than one qualified pet during the life of the taxpayer, as provided. In the case of spouses filing a joint return, the bill would apply these restrictions to each spouse separately. The bill would require a taxpayer to provide all information necessary to administer this credit, upon request and in the form and manner provided by the Franchise Tax Board, including, but not limited to, a declaration under penalty of perjury that the taxpayer has not previously claimed the credit. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property taxes."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
