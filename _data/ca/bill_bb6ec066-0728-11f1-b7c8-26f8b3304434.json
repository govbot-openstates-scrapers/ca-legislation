The bill would require the policy to require the California State University to consult with California Indian tribes, including on specified topics. The bill would also require the policy to require that any proposed location for the reburial of repatriated Native American human remains be mutually agreed upon by the California State University and the California Indian tribes that are culturally affiliated with the potential reburial land."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
