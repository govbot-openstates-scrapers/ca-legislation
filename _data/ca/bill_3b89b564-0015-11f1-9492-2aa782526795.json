Under existing law, if a vehicle accident results in permanent, serious injury or death, a person who violates the requirement to stop is subject to punishment by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years, or in a county jail for not less than 90 days nor more than one year, or by a specified fine, or both the imprisonment and fine. Existing law requires a person who flees the scene of the crime after committing specified vehicle manslaughter while intoxicated or vehicle manslaughter to be punished for an additional term of imprisonment of 5 years in the state prison, upon conviction, and in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed.\n\nThis bill would instead require a person who violates the requirement to stop to be subject to punishment by imprisonment in the state prison for 7, 8, or 9 years if the vehicle accident results in permanent, serious injury or death."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
