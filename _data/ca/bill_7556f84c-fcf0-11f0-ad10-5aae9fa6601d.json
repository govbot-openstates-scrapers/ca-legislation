Existing law requires the secretary to establish the Vertebrate Pest Control Research Advisory Committee, and requires the committee to make recommendations to the secretary regarding vertebrate pest control research each year. Existing law requires each county agricultural commissioner to pay a specified fee to the secretary based on the amount of vertebrate pest control material sold, distributed, or applied by the county, as specified. Existing law creates the Vertebrate Pest Control Research Account in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund, and continuously appropriates the moneys in the account to the secretary for specified purposes. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of those provisions until January 1, 2035. By extending the secretary's authority to expend moneys in a continuously appropriated account, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(2) Existing law prohibits the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as specified.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast that provision to instead prohibit the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs to livestock unless it is ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive that complies with federal and state law, require prescriptions for labeled uses of medically important antimicrobial drugs to be issued pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, and require veterinary feed directives and prescriptions for extralabel uses of medically important antimicrobial drugs to be issued pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as specified.\n\n(3) Existing law regulates the operation of certified mobile farmers' markets, as defined, and requires an operator of a certified mobile farmers' market to annually register with the Department of Food and Agriculture.\n\nThis bill would authorize enforcing officers to inspect places, conveyances, documentation, products, containers, and equipment pertaining to certified mobile farmers' markets and would authorize enforcing officers to seize and hold as evidence certain materials to secure the conviction of a party, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pest control: vertebrate pest control research: repeal extension."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
