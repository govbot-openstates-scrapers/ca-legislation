Existing law requires the governing board of each school district and each office of the county superintendent of schools to include specified provisions in their contracts for audits and requires financial and compliance audits to be performed in accordance with specified standards. If the governing board of a school district has entered into a contract for an independent audit of its financial statements and the audited financial statements have not been filed with the county superintendent of schools on or before a specified due date, existing law authorizes the county superintendent of schools to, among other things, investigate the causes for the delay, as provided.\n\nThis bill would expressly apply the above-described provisions to educational joint powers authorities and charter schools. The bill, among other things, would require those financial and compliance audits of local educational agencies to be conducted in accordance with specified filing deadlines and would revise requirements regarding which entity is responsible for providing an audit if a local educational agency has not provided for an audit of their respective books and accounts to include the Controller or a chartering authority, as provided. The bill would require, instead of authorize, a county superintendent of schools to investigate the causes for an above-described delay. The bill would require a local educational agency to post the local educational agency's annual financial and compliance audits on its internet website.\n\nExisting law requires the Controller to, among other things, on an annual basis, review and monitor the audit reports performed by independent auditors, determine whether audit reports are in conformance with specified reporting provisions, and notify each local educational agency, the responsible county superintendent of schools, the Superintendent, the Department of Finance, and the auditor regarding each determination. Existing law authorizes the Controller to perform quality control reviews of audit working papers to determine whether audits are performed in conformity with those specified standards. Existing law requires the Controller to annually report to the State Department of Education to apprise the department of school districts and offices of county superintendents of schools that are not in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations related to audits and requires the Controller to make recommendations as to what action should be taken by the department.\n\nThe bill would require the Controller to, if applicable, notify the responsible chartering authority of each determination made, as referenced above, and would require notification to applicable entities to be made within 6 months of the audit report due date or the audit report issue date, whichever is later. The bill would require the Controller to establish and publish as part of the audit guide a weighted risk-based criteria that considers auditor experience and quality factors in determining which audit engagements are required to undergo a quality control review, as provided. The bill would require the Controller to instead report and provide recommendations to the Superintendent of entities not in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and would include educational joint powers authorities and charter schools as reported entities.\n\nThe bill, commencing with the 2027\u201328 fiscal year Guide for Annual Audits of K\u201312 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, would require the Controller to include, among other things, instructions requiring specified supplemental information and schedules in audit report components for local educational agency audits and an appendix with the Controller's desk review checklist that is used to determine whether audit reports are in conformance with specified reporting requirements, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires audits to be made by a certified public accountant or a public accountant, licensed by the California Board of Accountancy, and selected by a local educational agency, as applicable, from a directory of certified public accountants and public accountants deemed by the Controller as qualified to conduct audits of local educational agencies.\n\nIn order to be added to, or remain on, the Controller's directory of certified public accountants and public accountants as described above, the bill would require, commencing with the 2027\u201328 fiscal year, and every 2 years thereafter, audit engagement partners and certified public accountants or public accountants responsible for local educational agency audits to, among other things, complete 16 hours of continuing education, demonstrate specified experience, and maintain compliance with the California Board of Accountancy requirements to keep applicable licenses in active status and good standing, as provided. The bill would also apply the continuing education requirement to audit staff who perform audit procedures of local educational agencies.\n\nTo the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies or local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the State Department of Education, under the administration of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and assigns to it numerous duties relating to the governance and financing of the public elementary and secondary schools of this state.\n\nThis bill would establish the Office of the Education Inspector General. The bill would provide for the appointment of the Education Inspector General by the Governor from a list of 3 qualified individuals nominated by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, subject to confirmation by a vote of the majority of the membership of the Senate. The bill would require the Education Inspector General to, among other things, (A) conduct and supervise forensic audits and investigations of the programs and operations of the department, school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, educational joint powers authorities, state special schools, and entities managing charter schools related to fraud, misappropriation of funds, and other illegal practices and (B) annually report to the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature on investigations and audits of the programs and operations of the department, local educational agencies, and entities managing a charter school.\n\n(3) Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to establish standards for the issuance and renewal of credentials, certificates, and permits. Existing law requires the commission and the department to enter into a data sharing agreement for the department to provide the commission with educator assignment data necessary to annually identify educator misassignments and vacant positions at local educational agencies, as provided, as part of the State Assignment Accountability System. Existing law requires the commission to annually use data it receives from the department to produce an initial data file of vacant positions and educator assignments that do not have a clear match of credential to assignment and requires the commission to notify local educational agencies and monitoring authorities of the opportunity to access and review the initial data file of potential misassignments, as defined, and vacant positions. Existing law grants the commission the authority to make a final determination for all potential misassignments. Existing law requires, commencing with the 2020\u201321 school year, the commission to make annual educator assignment, misassignment, and vacant position data publicly available on its internet website.\n\nThis bill would require teachers employed by a local educational agency and offering certain courses to hold the certificate, permit, or other document required by the commission for that assignment and be monitored. To the extent that this provision would create new duties for county superintendents of schools and local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law establishes a public school financing system that requires state funding for school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to be calculated pursuant to a local control funding formula, as specified. Existing law includes average daily attendance as a component of the calculation under the local control funding formula. Existing law establishes the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System, which is maintained by the State Department of Education and consists of pupil data from elementary and secondary schools, as specified, relating to demographics, program participation, enrollment, and statewide assessments, among other things.\n\nThis bill would require the department to, by January 1, 2030, and in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team, complete a report with specified data relating to the possible integration of the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System and the average daily attendance apportionment data system, and would require the department to provide the report to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, as provided.\n\n(5) Existing law requires the Superintendent, if, during any fiscal year, the amount apportioned to a school district or to any fund from Section A of the State School Fund differs either positively or negatively from the amount to which the school district or fund was entitled by an amount equal to the local control funding formula allocation for one unit of average daily attendance, not later than the first succeeding fiscal year from the fiscal year in which the computational error was made, to withhold from, or add to, the apportionment made during that fiscal year, the amount of the excess of deficiency, as the case may be.\n\nThis bill would require the Superintendent to apply the above-described provisions to county offices of education and charter schools. If, during any fiscal year, a school district, county office of education, or charter school determines that the amount apportioned to the school district, county office of education, charter school, or to any fund from Section A of the State School Fund differs either positively or negatively from the amount to which the school district, county office of education, charter school, or fund was entitled by an amount equal to the local control funding formula allocation for one or more units of average daily attendance, the bill would require the local educational agency to report the corrected amount to the Superintendent. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on a local educational agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires state funding to be calculated and withheld from a school district or county office of education for any fiscal year in which a person renders service as a teacher in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, who does not have a valid certification document, as provided.\n\nThe bill would apply the above-described provisions relating to the penalties for a person rendering services as a teacher who does not have a valid certification document to charter schools, as provided.\n\n(6) The Charter Schools Act of 1992 authorizes the establishment, operation, and governance of charter schools. Existing law requires a petition to establish a charter school to include reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain things, including the manner in which annual, independent financial audits shall be conducted, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the chartering authority.\n\nCommencing July 1, 2028, the bill would require each chartering authority to, with respect to each charter school under its authority, (A) annually review specified data relating to the reporting of average daily attendance by nonclassroom-based charter schools, (B) review the agenda and minutes of the meetings of the governing body of the charter school, (C) annually attend at least one meeting of the governing body of the charter school, as specified, and (D) identify and provide notification to the governing body of the charter school of any material concern arising out of the chartering authority's ongoing oversight and monitoring activities.\n\nThe bill would authorize the State Board of Education, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to revise regulations, including emergency regulations, to require charter schools to prepare periodic and annual financial data in the same manner prescribed for school districts, as provided. The bill would phase in, from the 2028\u201329 fiscal year to the 2030\u201331 fiscal year, inclusive, and based on the average daily attendance of the charter school and whether the charter school is a nonclassroom-based charter school, the requirement that charter schools report this data in the same manner prescribed for school districts, as provided.\n\nThe bill would require the state board to appoint an advisory committee on charter schools that would include representatives from school district superintendents, charter schools, teachers, members of the governing boards of school districts, county superintendents of schools, and the Superintendent.\n\nThe bill would prohibit a school district with an average daily attendance of fewer than 10,000 pupils from authorizing one or more nonclassroom-based charter schools or approving a material revision to expand one or more nonclassroom-based charter schools if doing so would result in more than a totality of 100% of the average daily attendance of the school district and would create an exception for a nonclassroom-based charter school in operation on or before December 31, 2025, that exceeds that limitation if, as of December 31, 2025, certain requirements are met.\n\nThe bill would require charter schools to obtain the approval of the governing body of the charter school for any contract that would cause the charter school to compensate an individual contractor more than $100,000 in a fiscal year.\n\nExisting law requires the amount of funding to be allocated to a charter school on the basis of average daily attendance that is generated by pupils engaged in nonclassroom-based instruction, as defined, to be adjusted by the state board, as provided.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, requiring the above-described determination for funding to instead be on a percentage basis and requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to implement the determination for funding by reducing the charter school's reported average daily attendance by the determination for funding percentage specified by the state board, as provided. The bill would require charter schools to adhere to specified criteria when submitting a funding determination request, as provided. The bill would require the Superintendent to notify the chartering authority of a charter school that is maintaining an unassigned fund balance for economic uncertainties that is 5% or less of the charter school's annual expenditures.\n\nBeginning with the 2027\u201328 school year, the bill would require the State Department of Education to annually develop a list that identifies networks of nonclassroom-based charter schools, as defined, based on data from the prior school year.\n\nTo the extent that these additions to the act would impose new duties on local educational agencies, they would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(7) This bill would establish the Chartering Authority Mentor Grant Program to be administered by the Superintendent for the purpose of providing chartering authority mentors with grants to provide technical assistance to eligible chartering authorities of charter schools.\n\nThe bill would establish the Charter School Authorizer Grant Program within the department to provide grants to chartering authorities for certain increased costs associated with the responsibilities imposed by this bill, as provided.\n\nThe bill would establish the Charter School Standardized Account Code Structure Grant Program within the department to provide grants of up to $50,000 per charter school that has not fully implemented the Standardized Account Code Structure as of June 30, 2025, as provided.\n\n(8) Existing law authorizes a school district, county office of education, or charter school to offer independent study to meet the educational needs of pupils when certain requirements are met, including, among others, that the local educational agency has adopted written policies, and implemented those policies, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Superintendent, as specified. Existing law, for purposes of independent study, requires those programs to meet specified average-daily-attendance-to-certificated-employee ratios. Existing law authorizes a local educational agency to claim apportionment credit for independent study only to the extent of the time value of pupil work products. Existing law prohibits school districts and county offices of education from being eligible to receive apportionment for independent study attendance by any pupil who is not otherwise identified in the written records of the school district or county board of education, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, among other things, extend the latter-described prohibition to charter schools, revise required average-daily-attendance-to-certificated-employee ratios, and add requirements to the independent study policies and procedures, as provided. The bill would require a local educational agency to maintain one completed pupil work product in each of 4 specified subjects for a pupil enrolled in independent study for each of 3 specified attendance periods, except as provided.\n\nThe bill would require the governing board or body of a school district, educational joint powers authority, county office of education, or charter school, on or before July 1, 2027, to adopt a policy in order to evaluate and approve contractors. The bill would require the policy to include specified provisions, including, among other things, that a local educational agency is prohibited from (A) expending public funds for a contract unless the materials, programs, and activities are nonsectarian, (B) offering financial payments or gifts as an incentive for pupil enrollment, referral, or retention, and (C) purchasing or contracting for season passes or membership to amusement or theme parks, zoos, or family entertainment activities, except as provided.\n\n(9) Existing law requires any entity that has a contract with a school district, county office of education, or charter school to ensure that any employee who interacts with pupils, outside of the immediate supervision and control of the pupil's parent or guardian or a school employee, has a valid criminal records summary, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require an entity that has a contract with a local educational agency to instead ensure any employee who interacts with pupils has a valid criminal records summary without regard to whether the interaction takes place outside of the immediate supervision and control of the pupil's parent or guardian or a school employee.\n\n(10) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "School accountability: Office of the Education Inspector General: school financial and performance audits: charter school authorization, oversight, operations, and contracting: data systems."}, {"note": "", "title": "School accountability: audits: charter schools: data systems."}, {"note": "", "title": "School accountability: Office of the Education Inspector General: school financial and performance audits: charter school authorization, oversight, funding, operations, networks, and contracting: data systems: local educational agency contractor background checks."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
