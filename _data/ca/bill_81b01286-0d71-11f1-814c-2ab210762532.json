Existing law establishes procedures for the disposal of surplus land, including requiring certain information to be provided to the Department of Housing and Community Development. These procedures do not apply to the disposal of exempt surplus land. Existing law establishes various categories of exempt surplus land, including surplus land that is a former street, right-of-way, or easement, and is conveyed to an owner of an adjacent property.\n\nThis bill would broaden the definition of exempt surplus land to include land that is unsuitable for housing development due to the presence of one or more specified characteristics, including land with slope instability that increases risk of mudslides, landslides, subsidence, liquefaction, and other seismic hazards."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
