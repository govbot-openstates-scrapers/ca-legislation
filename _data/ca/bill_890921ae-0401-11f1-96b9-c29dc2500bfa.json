Existing law authorizes any county to conduct an all-mailed ballot election under certain conditions.\n\nThis bill would repeal the provisions requiring county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter and authorizing a county to conduct an all-mailed ballot election. The bill would instead authorize a voter to request a vote by mail ballot for any election, as specified. The bill would also authorize and establish procedures for a voter to apply to become a permanent vote by mail voter. The bill would require a county elections official to mail a vote by mail ballot for each election to a voter who has qualified to become a permanent vote by mail voter.\n\nBy establishing new duties for local elections officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Environmental Protection Program: administration."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
