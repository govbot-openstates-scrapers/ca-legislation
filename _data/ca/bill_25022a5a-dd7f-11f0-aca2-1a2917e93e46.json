The act requires certain professionals, including specified health practitioners and social workers, known as \"mandated reporters,\" to report known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to a local law enforcement agency or a county welfare or probation department, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Social Services, through the State Office of Child Abuse Prevention, to, by no later than July 1, 2027, develop a standardized curriculum for mandated reporters, and to make that training available on its internet website. The bill would, except as provided, require an employer having one or more mandated reporters to ensure completion of the training within the first 3 months of the mandated reporter's employment, or on or before March 1, 2030, whichever is later. The bill would require completion of the training to be documented in a manner that would allow the department to verify completion upon request.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Health Care Services to provide updates every 90 days to specified legislative committees on guidance to counties with respect to payer of last resort federal requirements and revenue maximization of specified funding sources for services related to these provisions, until those committees make findings that this requirement has been met.\n\nExisting law establishes the California Child Welfare Council to serve as an advisory board responsible for improving the collaboration and processes of the multiple agencies and the courts that serve the children and youth in the child welfare and foster care systems. Existing law requires the council to monitor and report the extent to which child welfare and foster care programs and the courts are responsive to the needs of children in their joint care.\n\nThis bill would require the California Child Welfare Council to establish a Mandated Reporting Advisory Committee, as specified, and would state the intent of the Legislature that the committee ensure the transformation of mandated reporting to community supporting continues and disparities in the child welfare system are eliminated.\n\nThe federal Family First Prevention Services Act provides a state with the option to use certain federal funds to provide mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services and in-home parent skill-based programs to a child who is a candidate for foster care or a child in foster care who is a pregnant or parenting foster youth, as specified. Existing state law authorizes a county to elect to provide those prevention services by providing a written plan to the State Department of Social Services, which has oversight of the Family First Prevention Services program. Existing law requires the county to consult with other relevant county agencies, as specified, in the development of the plan.\n\nThe bill would require each county's written plan to include the county's plans to provide information for mandated reporters regarding resources available to support families in their communities. By imposing additional duties on counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
