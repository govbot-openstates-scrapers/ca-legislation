The department is authorized to cooperate and contract with the duly authorized representative of the United States government in carrying out its duties. Existing law provides various benefits to veterans and their dependents including opportunities for veterans to continue their education. Existing federal law provides educational awards for eligible active duty members and veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThis bill would create the California State Accrediting Agency for Veterans Education (CSAAVE) within the department. The bill would require the CSAAVE to implement federal requirements and administer state requirements for an organization that is seeking authorization to offer education awards under federal law, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to adopt and amend regulations to implement these provisions.
