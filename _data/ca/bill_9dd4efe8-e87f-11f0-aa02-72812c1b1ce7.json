Existing law requires a transit operator that receives funds through the Mills-Alquist-Deddeh Act and that provides dial-a-ride or paratransit service to provide those services consistent with certain requirements.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before January 1, 2027, transit operators, as defined, to establish a streamlined recertification process for eligible persons, as specified. The bill would require, on and after June 1, 2027, transit operators to only use the streamlined recertification process for eligible persons unless certain conditions apply. The bill would define \"eligible persons\" as persons who receive, or who are eligible to receive, paratransit services based on a disability and whose disability cannot reasonably be expected to improve over time, as determined by the person's qualified licensed medical professional, and whose ability to access the fixed route system cannot reasonably be expected to improve over time, as determined by the transit operator. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on a local agency, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State Air Resources Board: regulations: ocean-going vessels: alternative fuels."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
