Existing law requires the Governor to coordinate the State Emergency Plan and the preparation of plans and programs for the mitigation of the effects of an emergency by the political subdivisions of this state. Existing law defines the terms \"political subdivision\" and \"emergency plans\" for purposes of emergency services provided by local governments. Existing law requires the governing body of each political subdivision of the state to carry out the provisions of the State Emergency Plan. Existing law requires the office to establish best practices for counties developing and updating a county emergency plan and a process for a county to request that the office review a county's emergency plan by January 1, 2022.\n\nThis bill would require each county to review and update its emergency plan at least every 2 years. Because the bill would require local officials to perform additional duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would remove the January 1, 2022, date specified above, and would remove another reference to that date.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
