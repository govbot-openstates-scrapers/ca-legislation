Existing regulations prescribe specified deadlines by which an insurer is required to, among other things, respond to a notice of claim, accept or deny a claim, in whole or in part, and, upon acceptance of a claim in whole or in part, tender payment or otherwise take action to perform its obligation, as specified.\n\nThis bill, with respect to fire insurance claims arising after January 1, 2027, would codify specified provisions of the regulations prescribing the deadlines above. The bill would also make an insurer that does not comply with the deadlines liable to the insured for interest on the amount of the accepted claim, in whole or in part, at the rate of 20% per year as damages, together with reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, in addition to the amount the insured is entitled to under the policy.\n\nThis bill would require, by January 2028, and quarterly thereafter, an insurer to provide a prompt-payment compliance data report in accordance with the above-described provisions to the department, as provided. The bill would require a corporate officer of the insurer to sign the report under penalty of perjury. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Commencing July 1, 2028, the bill would require the department to compile the information and publish a quarterly report on its internet website that details each insurer's prompt-payment compliance data, as specified. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
