The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms in regulating those emissions. The implementing regulations adopted by the state board provide for the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical corporations pursuant to a market-based compliance mechanism.\n\nExisting law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory jurisdiction over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law, except as provided, requires revenues received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to be credited directly to residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers of the electrical corporation, commonly known as the California Climate Credit.\n\nThis bill would require the credit provided to residential customers of an electrical corporation to be provided on the bills of those customers for the months of July, August, and September of each year, or as otherwise directed by the commission to address extreme, unforeseen, and temporary circumstances. The bill would require the credit to be volumetric, rather than independent of consumption.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act, or of an order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission, is a crime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be part of the Public Utilities Act, and a violation of a commission action implementing its requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Electricity: clean energy transmission projects: utility infrastructure undergrounding: financing."}, {"note": "", "title": "Electricity: utility infrastructure undergrounding: financing."}, {"note": "", "title": "Electricity: transmission projects: review and approval."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
