Existing law requires a trust beneficiary to be provided notice of specified actions regarding the trust. Existing law sets forth requirements under which notice given to a specified person or class of persons is sufficient to comply with a requirement that notice be given to a trust beneficiary or a person interested in the trust.\n\nThis bill would delete that indirect notice provision and would instead provide that notice given to a person authorized to represent and bind another person is sufficient to comply with notice requirements for actions regarding a trust. If a person consents for a person to represent and bind them, the bill would require that consent to be in writing and would make consent binding on the represented person unless they object to the representation before consent would have become effective. The bill would prohibit certain persons from representing and binding another person for these purposes, and would authorize specified representative relationships and representation of successive interests."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
