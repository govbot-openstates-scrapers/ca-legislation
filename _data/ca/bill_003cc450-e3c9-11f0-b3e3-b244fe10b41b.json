Existing law requires educators, county placing agencies, care providers, advocates, and the juvenile courts to work together to maintain stable school placements and to ensure that each pupil is placed in the least restrictive educational programs, and has access to the academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all pupils, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services and county offices of education, to administer competitive grants as part of a pilot program, to be known as the Unaccompanied Youth Transitional Housing Program, for purposes of enabling school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to partner with local nonprofits, as defined, and to offer 5-year grants to fund transitional housing projects for unaccompanied homeless youth who are 16 and 17 years of age, and would require grant funds to be used for, among other things, referrals to residential facilities with single-occupant units, provision of clothes, nutritious meals, and stipends for public transportation, and educational support services, as specified. The bill would also require funding preference under the program to be given to local educational agencies that partner with nonprofits that demonstrate certain characteristics, as provided."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "School districts: local authority."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
