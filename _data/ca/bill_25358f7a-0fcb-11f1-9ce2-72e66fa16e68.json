Existing law requires the Office of Emergency Services to include in the State Hazard Mitigation Plan an evaluation of risks from specified causes of a long-term electrical outage and, based on that analysis, requires the plan to identify cost-effective and feasible measures to lessen risks from those hazards, including, hardening the critical infrastructure of electrical utilities.\n\nThis bill would state that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that ensures California's electric vehicle charging infrastructure will remain operational during a disaster."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
