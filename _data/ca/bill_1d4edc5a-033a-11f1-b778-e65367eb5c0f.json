Existing law requires the department, in partnership with CaliforniaVolunteers, to review available evidence on ways to incorporate effective service learning for pupils in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, develop model uniform metrics for the measurement of pupil progress, provide recommendations to the Legislature on, and post on the department's and CaliforniaVolunteers' internet websites information related to, evidence-based strategies to expand access to high-quality service learning programs, as provided. Existing law, commencing with the 2022\u201323 fiscal year, appropriates $5,000,000 from the General Fund, each fiscal year, to the department to award grants of up to $500,000 annually to local educational agencies in which at least 55% of enrolled pupils are unduplicated pupils, as defined, to be used for, among other things, the purchase of instructional materials and participation and personnel costs, as provided.\n\nThis bill would expand the California Serves Program to promote access to effective service learning for pupils in grades 1 to 12, inclusive, who are enrolled at participating local educational agencies. By expanding the purposes of ongoing appropriations, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require the department, in partnership with CaliforniaVolunteers, on or before January 1, 2027, to (A) review available evidence on ways to incorporate effective service learning for pupils in grades 1 to 12, inclusive, (B) develop model uniform metrics for the measurement of pupil progress for grades 1 to 12, inclusive, and (C) provide recommendations to the Legislature on, and post on the department's and CaliforniaVolunteers' internet websites information related to, evidence-based strategies to expand access to high-quality service learning programs for grades 1 to 12, inclusive, as provided.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the State Seal of Civic Engagement to recognize pupils who have demonstrated excellence in civics education and participation and have demonstrated an understanding of the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and the democratic system of government, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to implement a Civic Engagement Pathway Program for pupils in grades 1 to 8, inclusive, to increase pupil awareness and civic engagement in democratic governmental institutions at the local, state, and national levels, and to provide civic learning resources and support for teachers to implement that programming. The bill would require the Civic Engagement Pathway Program to provide opportunities for pupils in grades 1 to 8, inclusive, to engage in civic engagement experiences with governmental institutions that are supportive of pupils earning the State Seal of Civic Engagement, as provided. The bill also would encourage those local educational agencies to establish local recognition programs to recognize pupils participating in a Civic Engagement Pathway Program based on locally developed criteria. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law requires the State Board of Education and the department to request that the Instructional Quality Commission review and revise, as necessary, the course requirements in the history-social science framework, as specified. Existing law requires, whenever the history-social science framework is revised as required by law, the commission to, among other things, consider how civics and history instruction, at all appropriate grade levels, includes, in addition to the acquisition of content knowledge, the application of that content to develop the competence and skills needed for civic engagement.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to include civic engagement experiences with governmental institutions that are supportive of pupils earning the State Seal of Civic Engagement, as provided, when making the above-described consideration regarding civics and history instruction.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
