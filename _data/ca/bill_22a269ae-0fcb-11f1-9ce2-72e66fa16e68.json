The act requires a land use plan of a proposed local coastal program to be submitted to the California Coastal Commission for certification. Existing law requires local governments lying in whole or in part within the coastal zone to, on or before January 1, 2034, develop a sea level rise plan with specified required content as part of a local coastal program that is subject to approval by the California Coastal Commission.\n\nThis bill would authorize local governments lying, in whole or in part, within the coastal zone to include a neighborhood-scale adaptation approach, as defined, when including land use policies and implementation measures in their local coastal program or sea level rise plan. The bill would authorize the neighborhood-scale adaptation approach to include, but not be limited to, the identification of areas and assets that are subject to the approach, as specified, and policies that reflect the shared planning features and specific preferred adaptation strategies for different areas or development types based on the geophysical and land use characteristics intended to minimize, mitigate, or avoid coastal impacts."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
