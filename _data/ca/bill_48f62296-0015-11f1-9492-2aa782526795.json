Existing law establishes the State Coastal Conservancy with prescribed powers and responsibilities for implementing and administering various programs intended to preserve, protect, and restore the state's coastal areas. Existing law establishes surfing as the official state sport.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before July 1, 2026, the conservancy to establish criteria and an application process for purposes of designating an area of the coastline as a state surfing reserve, as defined. The bill would authorize a local government, as defined, to apply to the conservancy for purposes of designating an area of the coastline within the jurisdiction of the local government as a state surfing reserve. The bill would require the local government to include in its application, among other things, a description of the proposed surfing reserve. The bill would require the conservancy to approve the application if the area of the coastline meets the established criteria. The bill would require, once the application is approved, the conservancy to designate the area as a state surfing reserve. The bill would require the conservancy to, upon appropriation, publicize the state surfing reserve and partner with local governments to erect signs designating an approved surfing reserve, and would authorize the conservancy to accept donations for these purposes. The bill would authorize the conservancy to revoke the designation if the surfing reserve no longer meets the established criteria. The bill would require the conservancy to transmit notice of the approval of a designated surfing reserve to the Ocean Protection Council for consideration and inclusion in the state's 30x30 goal."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
