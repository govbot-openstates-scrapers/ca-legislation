Existing law, administered by the State Department of Social Services, provides for the establishment of a statewide electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system for the purpose of providing those financial and food assistance benefits. Existing law allows an interested collective group or association of produce sellers that is Food and Nutrition Service-authorized and in a flea market, farmers' market, or certified farmers' market to initiate and operate an EBT acceptance system in the market, as specified, and makes related findings and declarations. Under existing law, an individual seller may operate their own individual EBT acceptance activity as part of that seller's personal business customer transaction offering.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
