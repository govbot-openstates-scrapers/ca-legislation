Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy to provide coverage for behavioral health treatment for pervasive developmental disorder or autism. Existing law requires this treatment to be provided under a prescribed treatment plan that is reviewed no less than every 6 months by the qualified autism service provider.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a health care service plan or health insurer from imposing restrictions on the utilization of authorized treatment hours within the treatment plan's 6-month authorization period. The bill would require authorized hours to remain available for use throughout the authorization period. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
