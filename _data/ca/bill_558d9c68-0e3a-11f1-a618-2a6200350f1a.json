The bill would require the application to contain a statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that the individual for whom they hold power of attorney has a cognitive impairment. The bill would require the elections official, in producing any list, roster, or index, to exclude the voters with confidential voter status granted under these provisions.\n\nThe bill would require the Secretary of State to submit to the Legislature, no later than January 10 of each year, a report that includes the total number of applications received for confidential voter status under these provisions. \n\nBy increasing the duties of county elections officials with regard to confidential voter information and by expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
