The bill would require the commission to establish an application process and would require the loans issued under the program to have equivalent financial terms as the federal Direct PLUS Loans, as those terms existed on January 20, 2025, except for changes that the commission determines to be necessary to administer the program. The bill would create the Health Care Workforce Supplemental Loan Fund in the State Treasury."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
