Existing law provides that a person who commits those offenses against a person under 18 years of age shall be punished by imprisonment for 5, 7, or 9 years.\n\nThis bill would additionally punish assault with the intent to commit those specified offenses when committed against a dependent person, as defined, by a caretaker or other adult who has care or custody of the dependent person, if the caretaker or other adult knows or should reasonably know that the victim is a dependent person, with imprisonment for 5, 7, or 9 years. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
