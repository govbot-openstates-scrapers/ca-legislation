Existing law specifies the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the commission. Existing law levies an annual assessment on all fresh grapes during each marketing assessment, at an amount fixed by the commission not to exceed $0.006522 per pound. Existing law authorizes the commission to expend revenues from those assessments and all other moneys received by the commission, including from penalties for failing to pay the assessment and civil penalties for a violation of those provisions.\n\nThis bill would revise these provisions by, among other things, changing the district borders and revising the nomination election and appointment processes for producer members of the commission. The bill would require the commission to annually compile and maintain a list of eligible producers who are qualified to vote in an election, and certify the list to the secretary at least 30 days before the date set for any meeting to nominate commissioners to office. The bill would expand the activities, powers, and duties of the commission to also include accepting and matching contributions of funds and making contributions of commission funds to other persons or agencies, and administering any program related to the table grape industry. The bill would increase the maximum amount of the above-described assessment to $0.02 per pound, thereby making an appropriation.\n\nThe bill would authorize a person aggrieved by an action of the commission to file a grievance with the commission or a duly authorized committee of the commission designated for that purpose, and to appeal from decisions of the commission to the secretary. The bill would require an action by the commission for any violation of these provisions to be commenced within 2 years from the date of discovery of the alleged violation and would require an action against the commission by any person to be commenced within 2 years from the date of the act of which the person complains."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
