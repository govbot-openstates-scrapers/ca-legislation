The bill would require that these materials be offered at cost or with minimal administrative fees added to homeowners, contractors, nonprofit organizations, and local governments in any area affected by a state of emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, storm, or other natural disaster, as specified. The bill would require that the materials only be used for recovery efforts that are directly linked to housing losses caused by a state of emergency.\n\nThis bill would prohibit its provisions from being interpreted to require the department to store or distribute materials.
