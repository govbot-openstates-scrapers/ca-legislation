Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law sets forth requirements by which a health care service plan or health insurer reimburses a provider for health care services.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a health care service plan or an insurer issuing group or individual policies of health insurance from using an automated process, system, or tool to downcode a claim, which is the unilateral alteration by a payer of the service or procedure code submitted on a claim resulting in a lower payment. The bill would set forth requirements for and limitations of downcoding decisions, and, if a claim is downcoded, would require a plan or insurer to provide a billing provider with specified information and a clear and accessible process for disputing downcoded claims. The bill would prohibit a plan or insurer from using downcoding practices in a targeted or discriminatory manner against physicians or other health care providers who routinely treat patients with high acuity, complex, or chronic conditions, and would authorize the departments to take action against a plan or insurer that engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory downcoding or that otherwise violates these provisions. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
