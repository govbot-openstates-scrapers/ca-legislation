{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB2211", "title": "Craft distilled spirits manufacturers: licenses and fees.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Craftdistilledspiritsmanufacturers", "licensesandfees"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, administered by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, regulates the application, issuance, and suspension of alcoholic beverage licenses. Existing law establishes the types of licenses and the annual fees to be charged therefor and specifies that for a craft distilled spirits manufacturer, the fee is $755. Existing law provides that all money collected as fees pursuant to the act as payments under these provisions are deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. Existing law provides that a violation of the act or a regulation adopted pursuant to the act is a crime.\n\nThis bill would also specify a fee of $755 for a duplicate craft distilled spirits manufacturer license.\n\nUnder existing law, a distilled spirits manufacturer's license or a craft distiller's license authorizes the licensee to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on or off the licensee's premises, subject to specified conditions. Existing law authorizes a licensed craft distiller to sell up to a specified volume, in any combination of prepackaged containers, per day, per consumer of distilled spirits manufactured or produced by the licensee at its premises to a consumer.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a craft distiller from selling distilled spirits to consumers or engaging in tasting activities at more than two licensed branch premises. The bill would include in the definition of \"licensed premises\" for this purpose, and for purposes of the authorizations described above, any branch premises located away from the licensed craft distiller's place of production and manufacturer for which a duplicate license has been issued by the department. Because the bill would expand the definition of an existing crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
