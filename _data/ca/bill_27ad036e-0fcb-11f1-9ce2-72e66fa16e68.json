Existing law requires the operator of a well to file a written notice of intention to commence drilling with, and prohibits any drilling until approval is given by, the supervisor or district deputy. Existing law prohibits the division from approving any notice of intention within a health protection zone, defined as the area within 3,200 feet of certain residential, educational, health care, detention, or business facilities, except approvals necessary for specified purposes.\n\nThis bill would provide that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation to redefine the setback rules for health protection zones to be based on emissions data rather than proximity to sensitive receptors."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
