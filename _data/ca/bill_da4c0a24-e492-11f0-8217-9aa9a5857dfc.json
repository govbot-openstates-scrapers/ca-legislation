The act prohibits, among other things, any punitive action against a public safety officer, denial of promotion on grounds other than merit, or threat of such treatment, because of the lawful exercise of the rights granted under the act, or the exercise of any rights under any existing administrative grievance procedure.\n\n Existing law, the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, prohibits the state from seeking a criminal conviction or sentence on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Existing law authorizes a defendant to file a motion in the trial court or, if judgment has been imposed, to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus to allege a violation of this prohibition.\n\nExisting law authorizes the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to revoke the certification of a peace officer if the officer has, while employed as a peace officer, engaged in serious misconduct including, among other things, demonstrating bias on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender identity or expression, housing status, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, or other protected status in violation of law or department policy or inconsistent with a peace officer's obligation to carry out their duties in a fair and unbiased manner.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a punitive action, denial of promotion on grounds other than merit, or a revocation of certification proceeding from being undertaken against any public safety officer on the basis of a court finding made in a challenge brought under the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, and would prohibit those court findings from being introduced for any purpose in any administrative appeal of a punitive action. The bill would require, if the defendant is represented by an attorney in a case brought under the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, in the prosecution of a writ of habeas corpus, or in the filing of a motion to vacate a conviction or sentence based on a violation of the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, and the motion or petition is based, in whole or in part, on the conduct of a law enforcement officer, the attorney to serve a copy of the motion on the law enforcement agency employing the officer.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Sections 745, 1473, and 1473.7 of the Penal Code proposed by AB 1071 to be operative only if this bill and AB 1071 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
