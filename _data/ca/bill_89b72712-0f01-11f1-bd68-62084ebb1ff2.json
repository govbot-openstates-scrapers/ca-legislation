Existing law requires that the plan include, among other things, child abuse reporting procedures, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require a comprehensive school plan to instead include child abuse or neglect reporting procedures and would additionally require a comprehensive school safety plan, when it is next reviewed and updated, or by no later than July 1, 2026, to include procedures specifically designed to address the supervision and protection of children from child abuse or neglect and sex offenses. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires school district and county office of education comprehensive school safety plans to include assessing school crime committed on school campuses and at school-related functions.\n\nThis bill would require school district and county office of education comprehensive school safety plans to instead include assessing all crime, not just school crime, committed on school campuses and at school-related functions.

Existing law provides that these provisions do not create any liability in a school district or its employees.\n\nThis bill would revise and expand the definition of \"violent crime\" for these purposes and would authorize a principal or their designee to also provide that same notification for sex offenses, as defined.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to, among other things, establish standards for the issuance and renewal of credentials, certificates, and permits, as specified. Existing law requires the commission to deny an application for the issuance of a credential or for the renewal of a credential, or to revoke a credential, for any person convicted of a sex offense, as defined. Existing law prohibits the governing board of a school district from employing or retaining in employment persons in public school service who have been convicted, or who have been convicted following a plea of nolo contendere to charges, of any sex offense, and prescribes numerous provisions, including required actions, relating to suspensions, dismissals, and leaves of absences of public school employees charged or convicted of a sex offense.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of \"sex offense\" for those purposes to include additional crimes, as provided. To the extent the expanded definition of sex offenses would impose additional duties on local educational agencies or other local entities or officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nIn addition to any other prohibition or provision, existing law prohibits a person who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony from being hired by a school district, as defined, or charter school in a position requiring certification qualifications or supervising positions requiring certification qualifications, and prohibits a school district, as defined, or charter school from retaining in employment a current certificated employee who has been convicted of a violent or serious felony, and who is a temporary employee, a substitute employee, or a probationary employee serving before March 15 of the employee's second probationary year, as provided.\n\nThis bill would apply those same prohibitions to persons who have been convicted of sex offenses, as defined, as provided.

Existing law requires a school district, county office of education, charter school, or state special school that has made a report of an employee's egregious misconduct to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to disclose this fact to a school district, county office of education, charter school, or state special school considering an application for employment from the employee, upon inquiry.\n\nThis bill would additionally apply those provisions to private schools and diagnostic centers operated by the State Department of Education.\n\n Existing law requires a person applying for a certificated position at a school district, county office of education, charter school, or state special school to provide that prospective employer with a complete list of every school district, county office of education, charter school, or state special school that the applicant has previously been an employee of, and requires school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and state special schools considering an applicant for a certificated position to inquire with each of those local educational agencies that previously employed the applicant as to whether the applicant, while previously employed by the local educational agency, was the subject of any credible complaints of, substantiated investigations into, or discipline for, egregious misconduct that were required to be reported to the commission. Existing law requires those local educational agencies, when responding to an inquiry as to whether it has made a report of egregious misconduct to the commission, to also provide the inquiring local educational agency with a copy of all relevant information that was reported to the commission within its possession.\n\nThis bill would additionally apply those provisions to private schools and diagnostic centers operated by the department, and would also prescribe similar provisions for noncertificated employees applicable to school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the department, and for employees of any position at private schools. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, on or before July 1, 2027, and contingent upon an appropriation for these purposes in the annual Budget Act or another statute, to develop a statewide data system that includes information relating to investigations of allegations of egregious misconduct of individuals serving in a noncertificated position for a local educational agency, as defined, or in any position for a private school.

By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would prohibit the commission from being responsible for verifying the truthfulness or legal sufficiency of the information submitted by local educational agency employers or private school employers.\n\nThis bill would, on or before July 1, 2026, require each governing board of a school district, county board of education, and governing body of a charter school or private school, and the department for purposes of state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the department, to (A) adopt written policies that promote safe environments for pupil learning and engagement, as specified, and (B) adopt written policies, plans, or specifications regarding school facilities, and the furnishing of school facilities, that address classroom and nonclassroom environments to promote safe environments for learning and engagement that are easily supervised.

The bill would encourage school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to work with their public entity risk pool joint powers authority or insurance provider to identify and adopt best practices known to prevent violent crimes, injury, sex offenses, and egregious misconduct.\n\n (4) Existing law requires the commission to appoint a Committee of Credentials and requires allegations of acts or omissions for which adverse action may be taken against applicants or holders of teaching or services credentials to be presented to the committee. Existing law authorizes the committee to commence an initial review upon the receipt of any of a list of specified documents or information.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the committee to commence an initial review upon the receipt of a record of a substantiated report or the receipt of a record of a start of an investigation followed by a change in employment status during an investigation entered into the statewide data system.\n\n(5) Existing law requires the State Department of Education, in consultation with the Office of Child Abuse Prevention in the State Department of Social Services to, among other things, (A) develop and disseminate to all school districts, county offices of education, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the department, and charter schools, and their school personnel in California, information regarding the detection and reporting of child abuse, and (B) provide statewide guidance on the responsibilities of mandated reporters who are school personnel, as specified.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2026, would, among other things, (A) require that information to additionally be developed and disseminated to private schools and school volunteers, and (B) require that guidance to include school volunteers who are mandated reporters.\n\nExisting law requires the State Department of Education to develop and disseminate to all school districts, county offices of education, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the department, and charter schools, and their school personnel in California, information regarding the prevention of abuse, including sexual abuse, of children on school grounds, by school personnel, or in school-sponsored programs, and to develop appropriate means of instructing school personnel regarding the prevention of abuse, including sexual abuse, of children on school grounds, by school personnel, or in school-sponsored programs.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2026, would, among other things, (A) require that information to additionally be developed and disseminated to private schools and school volunteers, and (B) require that means of instruction to include school volunteers.\n\nExisting law requires school districts, county offices of education, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the State Department of Education, and charter schools to provide annual training, using the online training module provided by the State Department of Social Services or an alternative training, to their employees and persons working on their behalf who are mandated reporters, as defined, on the mandated reporting requirements related to child abuse, as provided. Existing law also requires those entities to develop a process for all persons required to receive that training to provide proof of completing the training within the first 6 weeks of each school year or within the first 6 weeks of that person's employment. Commencing July 1, 2025, existing law additionally requires school districts, county offices of education, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the State Department of Education, and charter schools to, among other things, provide annual training to their employees on the prevention of abuse, including sexual abuse, of children on school grounds, by school personnel, or in school-sponsored programs, as provided, and applies the proof of training requirements to this training.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2026, would, among other things, additionally apply those provisions to private schools and school volunteers, as provided, and would require school districts, county offices of education, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the State Department of Education, private schools, and charter schools that do not use the online training module provided by the State Department of Social Services to use an equivalent training module developed specifically to meet those requirements, as provided.\n\n(6) Existing law authorizes a school district to provide abuse, including sexual abuse, and human trafficking prevention education, as provided, and authorizes a parent or guardian of a pupil to excuse their child from all or part of abuse, including sexual abuse, and human trafficking prevention education, and assessments related to that education, pursuant to a specified opt-out process, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, among other things, require the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in consultation with the Office of Child Abuse Prevention in the State Department of Social Services, local educational agencies, and public entity risk pool joint powers authorities that provide risk management services to California schools, on or before July 1, 2026, to (A) develop, (B) disseminate to all school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, state special schools and diagnostic centers operated by the State Department of Education, and private schools, and (C) post on the department's internet website, resources and information relating to appropriate boundaries, as provided.

The bill would authorize a parent or guardian of a pupil to excuse their child from all or part of the instruction pursuant to the same opt-out process described above.\n\n(7) Existing law, the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, establishes procedures for the reporting and investigation of suspected child abuse or neglect. The act requires certain professionals, including teachers, instructional aides, and classified employees, known as \"mandated reporters,\" to report known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to a local law enforcement agency or a county welfare or probation department, as specified. Failure by a mandated reporter to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect is a misdemeanor. The act provides that volunteers, except for volunteers of public or private organizations whose duties require direct contact with and supervision of children, except a volunteer of a Court Appointed Special Advocate program, are not mandated reporters.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast those provisions as they relate to the educational environment to instead make (A) employees, certain volunteers, and governing board or body members of a school district, county office of education, charter school, or private school, (B) employees, certain volunteers, and board members of public and private contractors to a school district, county office of education, charter school, state special school or diagnostic center operated by the department, or private school whose duties require contact or supervision of pupils at that school district, county office of education, charter school, state special school or diagnostic center operated by the department, or private school, and (C) employees and certain volunteers assigned to a state special school or diagnostic center operated by the State Department of Education, all mandated reporters under the act. By imposing the reporting requirements on a new class of persons, for whom failure to report specified conduct is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(8) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 32282 of the Education Code proposed by SB 98, to be operative only if this bill and SB 98 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(9) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 11165.7 of the Penal Code proposed by AB 653 and SB 402 to be operative only if this bill and either or both of those bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(10) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pupil safety: school employee misconduct: child abuse prevention: criminal communications with a minor."}, {"note": "", "title": "Sex equity in education: Title IX."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
