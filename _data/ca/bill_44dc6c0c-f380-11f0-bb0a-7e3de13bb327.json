Existing law sets forth the minimum requirements for a preliminary services credential with a specialization in administrative services, which include, among other requirements, completion of an entry-level program of specialized and professional preparation in administrative services or a one-year internship in a program of supervised training in administrative services, subject to approval by the commission, as provided. Existing law also sets forth the minimum requirements for a reading and literacy leadership specialist credential and a reading and literacy added authorization, which include, among other requirements, completion of a program of specialized and professional preparation, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to, no later than September 1, 2028, ensure that the program standards for the professional preparation of candidates for a preliminary services credential with a specialization in administrative services meets specified criteria, including, among other things, that the program standards include preparation on how to support teachers in delivering instruction through effective means for teaching literacy, as provided. The bill would require the commission to, no later than January 1, 2028, ensure that the program standards and teaching performance expectations for the professional preparation of candidates for the reading and literacy leadership specialist credential and the reading and literacy added authorization include preparation on how to deliver instruction and support teachers to deliver instruction through effective means for teaching literacy, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the state board to adopt basic instructional materials for use in kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive, for governing boards of school districts and county boards of education, subject to specified provisions, including, among others, that the State Board of Education adopt at least 5 basic instructional materials for all applicable grade levels in each of the specified subject areas, including, among others, language arts, including, but not limited to, spelling, reading, and English language development.\n\nThis bill would require the state board, on or before January 31, 2027, and in adherence with specified provisions related to followup adoptions, to adopt instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive, in English language arts and English language development, as provided. The bill would require the state board to ensure that instructional materials adopted pursuant to these provisions adhere to specified criteria. The bill would require, upon the adoption of instructional materials described above, the state board to update the state Guidance for Local Instructional Materials Adoptions to reflect the criteria described above. The bill would require a local educational agency to follow this guidance for purposes of adopting instructional materials and require a local educational agency that adopts materials that have not been adopted by the state board to certify that the materials align to the criteria described above. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "School facilities: heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems."}, {"note": "", "title": "Pupil literacy: administrative services credential program standards and professional development: instructional materials."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
