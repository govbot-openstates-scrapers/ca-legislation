Pursuant to constitutional authorization, existing property tax law excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" for these purposes the construction or addition of any active solar energy system, as defined, through the 2025\u201326 fiscal year.\n\nThis bill would extend, for lien dates commencing on or after January 1, 2027, and before January 1, 2031, the above-described exclusion for customer-sited, active solar energy systems with a system size of less than or equal to 2 megawatts and for customer-sited, active solar energy systems that are sited on the property of a public entity customer. The bill would make conforming changes. By imposing additional duties on local tax officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
