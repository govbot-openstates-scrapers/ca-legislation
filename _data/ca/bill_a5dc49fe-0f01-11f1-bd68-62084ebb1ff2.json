Existing law establishes the Public Safety Communications Division within the office and prescribes certain duties in regard to statewide public safety communications systems, including providing for coordination of, and comment on, plans, policies, and operational requirements from departments that utilize public safety communications in support of their principal function.\n\nThis bill would make the above-described duties the exclusive responsibility of the division and prohibit a state public agency from performing those duties, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would require the division to serve as the primary authority for all statewide and interjurisdictional public safety communications, and to provide oversight, management, and ongoing coordination of all statewide public safety communications systems. The bill would require state public agencies to utilize the public safety communications systems established and maintained under these provisions. The bill would prohibit the division, a state public agency, or a local public agency from entering into a contract for a technical, maintenance, or system support services without approval by the office. The bill would also prohibit a state or local public agency participating in the statewide public safety communications system from delegating, assigning, or entering into a contract for essential operation, duties, or functions of public safety communications, without approval or authorization from the office, as specified. The bill would require a state public agency, if it enters into a contract within the scope of work of the division staff, to notify the division's state bargaining representative immediately via email and make their best effort to connect with representative.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
