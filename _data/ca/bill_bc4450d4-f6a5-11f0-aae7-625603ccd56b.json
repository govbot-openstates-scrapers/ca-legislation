A violation of the hazardous waste control laws is a crime.\n\nExisting law requires a generator of hazardous waste to pay to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration a generation and handling fee for each generator site that generates a specified amount of waste, as provided, and authorizes DTSC to adopt regulations necessary to implement generator fees.\n\nExisting law exempts geothermal waste resulting from drilling for geothermal resources from the hazardous waste control laws for a specified reason. Existing law also exempts geothermal waste, excluding filter cake, that is generated from the exploration, development, or production of geothermal energy and that does not result from drilling for geothermal resources, from the hazardous waste control laws under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would require the DTSC to prepare and submit to the Legislature, no later than July 1, 2026, a study regarding the issues that would arise if geothermal waste that is not exempt from generation and handling fees pursuant to existing law is made exempt from those fees."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Environmental Quality Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
