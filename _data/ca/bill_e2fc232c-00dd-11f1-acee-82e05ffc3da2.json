The bill would authorize a worker to request, and require an employer to provide, a copy of the most recent 12 months of the worker's own data primarily used by an ADS to make a disciplinary, termination, or deactivation decision, as specified. The bill would require an employer that uses an ADS to assist in making a disciplinary, termination, or deactivation decision to provide the affected worker with a written postuse notice, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit an employer from discharging, threatening to discharge, demoting, suspending, or in any manner discriminating or retaliating against any worker for taking certain actions asserting their rights under the bill. The bill would require the Labor Commissioner to enforce the bill's provisions, authorize, in the alternative, any worker who has suffered a violation of these provisions to bring a civil action for damages, and authorize a public prosecutor to bring a civil enforcement action, as specified. The bill would set forth specified types of relief that a plaintiff may seek and specified penalties that an employer that violates these provisions is subject to, including a $500 civil penalty.\n\nThis bill would also provide that an employer who complies with the requirements related to notice in this bill is not required to comply with any substantially similar provisions under any other state law, except as specified. The bill would not apply to parties covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if the agreement contains specified information, including an explicit waiver of the bill's provisions. The bill would declare that its provisions do not prohibit any employer from complying with regulatory or contractual requirements in the provision of products or services to the federal government, as defined.\n\nThis bill would declare that its provisions are severable."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
