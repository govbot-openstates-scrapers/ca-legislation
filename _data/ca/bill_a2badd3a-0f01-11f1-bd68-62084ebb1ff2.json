Existing law defines unduplicated pupils for these purposes to mean a pupil who is classified as an English learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or a foster youth, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require local educational agencies, for purposes of offering access to expanded learning opportunity programs pursuant to those provisions, to prioritize offering access to unduplicated pupils."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
