The Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows various deductions from gross income in computing adjusted gross income under that law, including deductions for payments to individual retirement accounts, alimony payments, and interest on educational loans. \n\nThis bill, for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, would allow a deduction under the Personal Income Tax Law in computing adjusted gross income in an amount equal to the amount contributed by specified taxpayers during the taxable year to a CalABLE account. \n\nExisting law requires a bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
