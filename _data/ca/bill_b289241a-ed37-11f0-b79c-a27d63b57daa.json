Existing law requires educators, county placing agencies, care providers, advocates, and the juvenile courts to work together to maintain stable school placements and to ensure that each pupil is placed in the least restrictive educational programs, and has access to the academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all pupils, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services and county offices of education, to administer competitive grants as part of a pilot program, to be known as the Unaccompanied Youth Support Grant Program, for school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide temporary housing to reduce absenteeism, improve graduation rates, and provide pupils with a stable learning environment. The bill would require 5-year grants to be awarded to local educational agencies to fund transitional housing projects for unaccompanied homeless youth who are 16 and 17 years of age and who are not in foster care. The bill would require grant funds to be used for, among other things, referrals to existing social services support systems, provision of basic needs supports, financial support, and educational support services, as specified. The bill would also require funding preference under the program to be given to local educational agencies that partner with nonprofit organizations that demonstrate certain characteristics, as provided. The bill would require local educational agencies awarded grant funds under the program to submit annual reports to the department that include, among other things, a description of the expenditure of funds and the number and characteristics of unaccompanied homeless youth served."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Unaccompanied homeless pupils: Unaccompanied Youth Transitional Housing Program."}, {"note": "", "title": "School districts: local authority."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
