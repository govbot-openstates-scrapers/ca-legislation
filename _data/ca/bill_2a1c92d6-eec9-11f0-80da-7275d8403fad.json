{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1187", "title": "Firearms: safety certificates.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Firearms", "safetycertificates"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires any person who purchases or receives a firearm to possess a firearm safety certificate. Existing law also prohibits a person from selling or transferring a firearm to any person who does not possess a firearm safety certificate. A violation of either of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. Existing law requires a personal firearm importer, within 60 days of bringing any firearm into this state, to, among other things, submit a report including information concerning that individual and a description of the firearm in question to the Department of Justice. Existing law generally makes a violation of the Penal Code a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would also require that personal firearm importer to obtain a valid firearm safety certificate and include a copy of the valid firearm safety certificate within the report. The bill would prohibit a person from bringing a firearm into this state without obtaining a valid firearm safety certificate within 60 days, except as specified. By creating a new prohibition, this bill would create a new crime and therefore impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires an applicant for a firearm safety certificate to pass a test developed by the Department of Justice covering specified subjects, including, among others, the laws applicable to carrying and handling firearms and the responsibilities of ownership of firearms.\n\nThis bill would require an applicant for a firearm safety certificate, on or after July 1, 2027, to complete a training course no less than 8 hours in length that, among other things, includes instruction on firearm safety and handling and live-fire shooting exercises on a firing range. The bill would authorize the Department of Justice to promulgate regulations and provide additional information for the implementation of this subdivision.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
