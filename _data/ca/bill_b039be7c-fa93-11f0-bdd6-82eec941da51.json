Existing law requires the office to conduct ongoing research and evaluation on payers, fully integrated delivery systems, and providers to determine whether the definitions or other provisions of the act include those entities that significantly affect health care cost, quality, equity, and workforce stability. Existing law defines multiple terms relating to these provisions, including a health care entity to mean a payer, provider, or a fully integrated delivery system and a provider to mean specified entities delivering or furnishing health care services.\n\nThis bill would update the definitions applying to these provisions, including defining a provider to mean specified entities delivering or furnishing health care services. The bill would include additional definitions, including, but not limited to, a hedge fund to mean a pool of funds managed by investors for the purpose of earning a return on those funds, regardless of strategies used to manage the funds, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would require the office to conduct ongoing research and evaluation on management services organizations, as specified, and to establish requirements for management services organizations to submit data and other information as necessary to carry out the functions of the office.\n\nExisting law requires a health care entity to provide the Office of Health Care Affordability with written notice of agreements or transactions that do specified actions, including sell or transfer, among other things, a material amount of its assets to one or more entities.\n\nThe bill would similarly require a noticing entity, as defined, to provide the office written notice of agreements or transactions between the noticing entity and a health care entity or management services organization, or an entity that owns, or controls the health care entity or management services organization that perform the same specified actions described above. The bill would additionally require a management services organization to provide the office with written notice of any agreement or transaction between the organization and any other entity."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
