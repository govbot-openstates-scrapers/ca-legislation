Existing law requires specified assigned counsel to receive a reasonable sum for compensation and for necessary expenses, as determined by the court, to be paid out of the general fund of the county.\n\nThis bill would, commencing with contracts for indigent defense services entered into after January 1, 2027, revise the process and require a county or court, when contracting for the provision or administration of indigent defense services, to include certain elements in the contract or other agreement for indigent services, including requirements for compliance with the Office of the State Public Defender's California Standards for Contract and Panel Defense Systems. The bill would specify that, in the absence of a contract for indigent defense services, an agreement for the services shall meet the Office of the State Public Defender's California Standards for Contract and Panel Defense Systems, as specified. The bill would prohibit a county or court from entering into flat fee contracts, as defined, or per case compensation contracts. The bill would require the structure of the contract for indigent defense services to ensure that attorneys have the resources and time necessary to provide competent legal representation. The bill would require counties that contract with a private entity or law firm to manage and provide indigent defense services to provide all those contracts to the Office of the State Public Defender every 2 years. The bill would require counties to ensure that all contracts provide for an hourly rate or the hourly rate equivalent anticipated under the contract, as specified.\n\nThe bill would make related findings and declarations."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Crimes: punishments for misdemeanors."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
