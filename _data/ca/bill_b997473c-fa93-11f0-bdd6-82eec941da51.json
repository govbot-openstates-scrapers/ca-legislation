The act requires property acquired or developed with the grant money to be used by the grant recipient only for the purpose for which the grant moneys were requested and prohibits any other use of the area except by a specific act of the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would authorize the County of San Bernardino to dispose of up to 4.2 acres of property at Glen Helen Regional Park, including property acquired or improved with grant moneys from the above act, subject to the acquisition of replacement park property of equal or greater recreational value approved by the Department of Parks and Recreation, to be used for park purposes and at no cost to the state or the county, as provided. To exercise the authorization to dispose of the above-described property, the bill would require the county to, among other things, submit to the department an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the Glen Helen Regional Park property and the proposed replacement property, provide the department with preliminary title reports of the Glen Helen Regional Park property and the proposed replacement property, and, before the county disposes of the Glen Helen Regional Park property, enter into a final written agreement with the department to transfer all of the county's responsibilities and obligations to any grant contract applicable to the Glen Helen Regional Park property to the proposed replacement park property in perpetuity, as provided. The bill would require that these provisions become inoperative on January 1, 2029, if the County of San Bernardino has not acquired replacement park property on or before January 1, 2029."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
