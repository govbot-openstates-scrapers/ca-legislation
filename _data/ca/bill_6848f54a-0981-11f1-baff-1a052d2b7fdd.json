Existing law provides, for the 2021\u201322 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, that $300,000,000 shall be available to the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the program. Existing law requires an applicant to demonstrate a proportional dollar-for-dollar match and sets that amount for the 2021\u201322 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, at $2 for every $1 received from the program. Existing law prohibits an applicant from being awarded an amount higher than the amount that the allocation formula determines them to be eligible to receive under the program.\n\nExisting law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine, in collaboration with the executive director of the State Board of Education, and to make public on a preliminary basis at least 30 days before a regularly scheduled meeting of the state board, the allocation formula, specific funding amounts, the purposes for which grant funds may be used, allowable and nonallowable expenditures, and the number of grants to be awarded. Existing law requires that same information to also be provided in writing to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and the Governor within 30 days following final approval of the state board.\n\nThis bill would, for purposes of allocations commencing no later than the 2027\u201328 fiscal year and pursuant to the above-described requirements, require the Superintendent to determine, in consultation with the executive director of the state board, a revised allocation formula that ensures that all funds appropriated for the program in any given fiscal year are fully allocated to program applicants in that fiscal year."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
