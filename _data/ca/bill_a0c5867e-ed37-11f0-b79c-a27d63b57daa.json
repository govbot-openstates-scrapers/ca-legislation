Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires each electrical corporation and gas corporation to disclose on the billing statement of a residential customer certain information, including itemized components in the bill to identify state and local taxes, identification of delivery, generation, public purpose, and other charges, and the contact information for the commission's Consumer Affairs Branch.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, on or before June 1, 2026, to evaluate all customer billing and noticing requirements existing on January 1, 2026, that apply to gas or electric utilities, and to identify and consider potential avenues to consolidate and enhance billing transparency, including avenues that clearly show the source and value of each charge within each customer's bill, as specified, and use the most cost-effective communications channels, as provided. The bill would authorize the commission to seek and consider input from utilities and other relevant stakeholders to inform its evaluation and identification and consideration of potential avenues to consolidate notices and enhance billing transparency."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public utilities: billing statements: additional costs attributable to state requirements or programs."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
