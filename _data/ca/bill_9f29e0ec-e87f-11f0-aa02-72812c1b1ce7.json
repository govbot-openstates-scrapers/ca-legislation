{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1312", "title": "Hospital pricing.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Hospitalpricing"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires a hospital to provide patients with a written notice containing information about the availability of the hospital's discount payment and charity care policies, including information about eligibility and the contact information for a hospital employee or office from which a person may obtain further information about these policies. Existing law defines \"charity care\" and \"discount payment\" for these purposes. Existing law requires a hospital to provide to the Department of Health Care Access and Information a copy of its discount payment policy, charity care policy, eligibility procedures for those policies, review process, and the application for charity care or discounted payment programs, among other information. A violation of these provisions results in an administrative penalty, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, commencing July 1, 2027, require a hospital to screen a patient to determine if they meet specific criteria, including that the patient is enrolled in CalFresh or CalWORKs, and, if they do, presumptively determine that a patient is eligible for participation under the hospital's charity care policy and discount payment policy. The bill would require a hospital to screen a patient for eligibility if the patient meets other specified criteria, including, among others, that the patient is uninsured. The bill would prohibit a hospital from requiring a patient to apply for the federal Medicare program, the Medi-Cal program, or other coverage before the patient is screened for or provided with discounted payment, as specified. The bill would require a hospital to provide patients with the ability to opt out of the screening process through a specified form. The bill would authorize a hospital, at its discretion or as established in its charity care policy or discount payment policy, to make presumptive determinations of eligibility or to conduct screening for patients that do not meet the criteria described above. The bill would authorize certain procedures and tools for screening, including, among others, allowing a hospital to use third-party software tools or services or to contract with a third party under specified conditions. The bill would require a hospital to provide a specified written notice to those patients determined to be eligible, presumptively or otherwise, under these provisions and would prohibit any billing statements from being sent prior to the written notice. The bill would require the billing statements to reflect the adjustments made to the patient's hospital charges under the hospital's charity care policy or discount payment policy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
