Under existing law, the advance health care directive of a patient in a skilled nursing facility is not effective unless a patient advocate or ombudsperson signs the advance directive as a witness and declares that they are serving as a witness pursuant to this requirement. Existing law authorizes a witness who is a patient advocate or ombudsperson to rely on the representations of the administrators or staff of the skilled nursing facility, or of family members, as convincing evidence of the identity of the patient, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete a patient advocate from the above-described witness duties, thus requiring that an ombudsperson witness the advance health care directive of a patient in a skilled nursing facility."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
