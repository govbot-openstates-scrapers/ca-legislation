Existing law requires specified forms filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to contain a social security account number. Existing law provides that information provided on those forms regarding a driver's license or identification card applicant's social security account number or ineligibility for a social security account number is not a public record and is not subject to disclosure by the department, except for specified reasons. \n\nThis bill would expand those exceptions by permitting the DMV to disclose specified information to participate in the State-to-State Verification Service for purposes of verifying and exchanging driver's license, identification card, and driver history records with participating jurisdictions.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
