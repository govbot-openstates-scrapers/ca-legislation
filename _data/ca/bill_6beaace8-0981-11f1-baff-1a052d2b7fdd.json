The bill would define \"credible crisis expression\" to mean a statement by a user of a companion chatbot that reasonably indicates, as determined through contextual analysis rather than keyword detection alone, intent to harm the user or others.\n\nThis bill would require an operator of a companion chatbot to document certain information related to credible crisis expressions and crisis interruption pauses and, beginning January 1, 2028, annually report that information to the Office of Suicide Prevention."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
