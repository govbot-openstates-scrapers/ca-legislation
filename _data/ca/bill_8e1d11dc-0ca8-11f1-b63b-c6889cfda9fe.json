Existing law authorizes the department to conduct announced or unannounced site visits to licensed facilities to review compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services to establish a pilot program to locate an investigator within a participating county to investigate complaints against licensed adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities within the county. The participating county would be the County of Orange if the Orange County Board of Supervisors elects to participate in the pilot program. The bill would require the department to implement the pilot program by executing a contract with the County of Orange providing that the department will assign an investigator and the county will reimburse the department for the costs associated with the pilot program, including, but not limited to, the administrative costs and the investigator's compensation and benefits. The bill would require the pilot program to be completed no later than December 31, 2029, and would require the county to submit a report of the results of the pilot program, as specified, to the Legislature no later than December 31, 2030.
