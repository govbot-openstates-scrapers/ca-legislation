Existing law requires the department to administer a specified competitive application process for capital improvement projects for large jurisdictions, as defined. For these purposes, existing law defines a qualifying infill project to include a residential or mixed-use residential project located within an urbanized area on a vacant site where at least 75% of the perimeter of the site adjoins parcels that are developed with urban uses.\n\n This bill would expand the definition of qualifying infill project to include a residential or mixed-use residential project located within an urbanized area on a vacant site where at least 75% of the perimeter of the site adjoins parcels that have been previously developed with urban uses.\n\nExisting law requires the department, in its review of applications, to rank affected qualifying infill areas and catalytic qualifying infill areas based on specified criteria, including the qualifying infill area's or catalytic qualifying infill area's inclusion of, or proximity to, a train station or major transit stop and the proximity of housing to existing or planned parks, employment or retail centers, schools, or social services.\n\nThis bill would revise these provisions to require the department to rank applications, as described above, based on the qualifying infill area's or catalytic qualifying infill area's inclusion of, or proximity or accessibility to, a transit station or major transit stop or walkability to essential services or businesses. The bill would additionally revise these provisions to require the department's ranking to be based on the proximity of housing to services, rather than social services.\n\nExisting law requires a qualifying infill project, qualifying infill area, or catalytic qualifying infill area for which a capital improvement project grant can be awarded under the program to meet specified conditions, including, among others, being located in an area designated for mixed-use or residential development, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally allow the project to be located in an area that allows for mixed-use or residential development pursuant to a housing development that is in compliance with certain provisions deeming a housing development an allowable use or subject to streamlined, ministerial approval.\n\nExisting law defines various terms for the purposes of the program, including, \"capital improvement project,\" \"catalytic qualifying infill area,\" \"eligible applicant,\" \"urbanized area,\" and \"urban uses.\"\n\nThis bill would revise these definitions. The bill would additionally define the terms \"major transit stop\" and \"walkability.\""}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
