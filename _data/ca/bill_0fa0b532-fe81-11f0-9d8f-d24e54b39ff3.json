Existing law requires the registry to contain information regarding persons who have identified themselves as organ and tissue donors upon their death. \n\nThis bill would require the Trustees of the California State University and request the Regents of the University of California to provide, for all campuses of their respective segments, and require each campus of the California Community Colleges to provide, educational information about Donate Life California and the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry to all incoming students. The bill would authorize a campus to disseminate this educational information in a manner that best fits the needs of the campus and its student population, as specified. The bill would require Donate Life California to provide all necessary resources to assist in the dissemination of the educational information, based on the needs of the campus, and would require Donate Life California to be available to confer and collaborate on an ongoing basis with all campuses. To the extent that the bill would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public postsecondary education: student orientation: Donate Life California."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
