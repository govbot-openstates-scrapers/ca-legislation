Under existing law, the protective order may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court.\n\nThis bill would additionally allow the court to issue a permanent protective order restraining a defendant from any contact with a victim if the defendant has been convicted of a registerable sex offense involving a minor victim. The bill would also authorize the court to permanently extend certain previously issued orders under certain circumstances. The bill would require the Judicial Council to develop forms, instructions, and rules relating to these orders.\n\nThe bill would make other conforming changes.\n\nBy authorizing the issuance of protective orders in certain circumstances and the extension of certain protective orders, a violation of which is punishable as a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
