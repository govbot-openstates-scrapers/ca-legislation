Existing law also requires the office to develop a treatment program for those purposes, which may include, among other things, state-funded treatment services in the form of telephone counseling. Existing law requires the office to make information available regarding this program as requested by the Governor and the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would delete the authorization for telephone counseling treatment services and instead authorize telehealth counseling. The bill would also require the office to make the information available if it is requested by a county health officer."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
