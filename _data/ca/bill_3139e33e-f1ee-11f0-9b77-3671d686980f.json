Existing rules of court allow a person with a disability or their representative to seek a permanent medical excuse from jury service and require the individual to submit a written request accompanied by a supporting letter, memo, or note from a treating health care provider, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a person 80 years of age or older to seek a permanent excuse from jury service without providing a supporting letter, memorandum, or note from a treating health care provider. The bill would require the court to permanently excuse a person who seeks the above-described permanent excuse from jury service. The bill would authorize the Judicial Council to adopt or amend a rule of court and publish related judicial forms as necessary to implement these provisions."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: development conditions: housing-forward jurisdictions."}, {"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: permitted use: housing forward jurisdictions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
