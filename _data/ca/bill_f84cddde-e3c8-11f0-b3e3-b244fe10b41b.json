{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB371", "title": "Dental coverage.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Dentalcoverage"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act's requirements a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law prohibits a contract between a plan or insurer and a dentist from requiring a dentist to accept an amount set by the plan or insurer as payment for dental care services provided to an enrollee or insured that are not covered services under the enrollee's contract or the insured's policy. Existing law requires a plan or insurer to make specified disclosures to an enrollee or insured regarding noncovered dental services.\n\nExisting law requires a health care service plan or health insurer to comply with specified timely access requirements. For a specified plan or insurer offering coverage for dental services, existing law requires urgent dental appointments to be offered within 72 hours of a request, nonurgent dental appointments to be offered within 36 business days of a request, and preventive dental care appointments to be offered within 40 business days of a request, as specified. Existing law requires a contract between a health care service plan and health care provider to ensure compliance with network adequacy standards and to require reporting by providers to plans to ensure compliance. Under existing law, a health care service plan is required to annually report to the Department of Managed Health Care on this compliance. Existing law authorizes the Department of Insurance to issue guidance to insurers regarding annual timely access and network reporting methodologies.\n\nIf a health care service plan or health insurer pays a contracting dental provider directly for covered services, this bill would require the plan or insurer to pay a noncontracting dental provider directly for covered services if the noncontracting provider submits to the plan or insurer a written assignment of benefits form signed by the enrollee or insured. The bill would require the plan or insurer to provide a predetermination or prior authorization to the dental provider and to reimburse the provider for not less than that amount, except as specified. The bill would require the plan or insurer to notify the enrollee or insured that the provider was paid and that the out-of-network cost may count towards their annual or lifetime maximum. The bill would require a noncontracting dental provider to make specified disclosures to an enrollee or insured before accepting an assignment of benefits.\n\nThis bill would require specified plans and insurers that cover dental services to offer urgent dental appointments within 48 hours of a request, nonurgent dental appointments within 18 business days of a request, and preventive dental care appointments within 20 business days of a request, as specified. The bill would subject dentists to the relevant department's regulatory geographic accessibility standards. The bill would require plans and insurers to report comprehensive information regarding the networks that each dental provider serves. The bill would require the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance to review the adequacy of an entire dental provider network, including the portions of the network serving plans and insurers not regulated by the respective department.\n\nBecause a willful violation of the above-described provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
