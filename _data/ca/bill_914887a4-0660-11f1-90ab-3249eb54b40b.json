{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB350", "title": "Health care coverage: fluoride treatments.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Healthcarecoverage", "fluoridetreatments"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act's requirements a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law sets forth specified coverage requirements for health care service plan contracts and health insurance policies.\n\nExisting law requires an individual or small group health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2017, to include, at a minimum, coverage for essential health benefits pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Existing law requires an essential health benefit to be provided only to the extent that federal law does not require the state to defray the costs of the benefit.\n\nThis bill would require a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, that provides coverage for the application of fluoride varnish as a pediatric oral care benefit to provide coverage without cost sharing for the application of fluoride varnish as medically necessary regardless of whether the service is billed as a dental benefit or as a medical benefit. If this coverage requirement creates an obligation for the state to defray costs for an individual, the bill would not require coverage unless there is an appropriation for this purpose, as specified. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which health care services are provided to low-income individuals. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law establishes a schedule of benefits under the Medi-Cal program and provides for various services, including certain dental services, that are rendered by Medi-Cal enrolled providers. Under existing law, silver diamine fluoride treatments are a covered benefit for eligible children 0 to 6 years of age, inclusive, as specified, and application of fluoride or other appropriate fluoride treatment is covered for children 17 years of age and under.\n\nThis bill would make the application of fluoride or other appropriate fluoride treatment, as defined by the department, a covered benefit under the Medi-Cal program for children under 21 years of age. The bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services to establish and promulgate a policy on or before January 1, 2027, that specifies this covered benefit includes the application of fluoride varnish, as specified, and that allows reimbursement in certain circumstances.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
