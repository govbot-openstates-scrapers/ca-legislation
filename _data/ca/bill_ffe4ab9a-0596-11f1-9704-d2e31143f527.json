Existing law defines a vehicle protection product for these purposes to mean a vehicle protection device, system, or service that is installed on, or applied to, a vehicle, is designed to deter the theft of the vehicle, and includes a written warranty that provides specified incidental costs if the product fails to deter the theft of the vehicle.\n\nExisting law requires, except as specified, a dealer or person holding a retail seller's permit who sells new or used vehicles equipped with a catalytic converter to permanently mark the catalytic converter with the vehicle identification number of the vehicle to which it is attached.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of a vehicle protection product to include a physical device, system, or service designed to prevent the unauthorized removal of a vehicle's catalytic converter, and would limit the warranty benefit for this vehicle protection product to the actual cash value and replacement cost of the catalytic converter, temporary vehicle rental expenses, and reimbursement for the insurance policy deductible. The bill would require the benefit to be payable upon the theft of the catalytic converter from the vehicle, as specified. The bill would also require a seller to disclose a specified notice if this vehicle protection product is a body part marking product designed to permanently mark the catalytic converter."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
