Existing law, the California Ocean Protection Act, establishes the Ocean Protection Council and provides that the purpose of the act is to integrate and coordinate the state's laws and institutions responsible for protecting and conserving ocean resources, including coastal waters and ocean ecosystems, to provide for public access to the ocean and ocean resources, including to marine protected areas, for recreational use, and aesthetic, educational, and scientific purposes, consistent with the sustainable long-term conservation of those resources, among other objectives. Existing law establishes surfing as the official state sport.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before July 1, 2027, the council to establish criteria and an application process for purposes of designating an area of the coastline as a state surfing reserve, as defined. The bill would authorize a local government to, after adopting a formal resolution, apply to the council for purposes of designating an area of the coastline within the jurisdiction of the local government as a state surfing reserve. The bill would require the local government to include in its application, among other things, a description of the proposed surfing reserve. The bill would require the council to approve the application if the area of the coastline meets the established criteria. The bill would require, once the application is approved, the council to designate the area as a state surfing reserve. The bill would require the council to, upon appropriation, publicize the state surfing reserve and partner with local governments to erect signs designating an approved surfing reserve, and would authorize the council to accept donations for these purposes. The bill would authorize the council to revoke the designation if the surfing reserve no longer meets the established criteria. The bill would require the council to include designated surfing reserves in the state's 30x30 goal."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
