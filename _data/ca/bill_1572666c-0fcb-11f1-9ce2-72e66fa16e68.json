Under existing law, a violation of these provisions or the rules and regulations promulgated under these provisions is a misdemeanor. Existing law specifically requires an applicant for certification as a home health aide to complete, among other requirements, a training program approved by the department. Under existing law, a certification for a home health aide is renewed every two years, and to renew an unexpired certificate, the certificate holder is required to apply for renewal on a form provided by the state, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require that either a registered nurse or a licensed vocational nurse, as specified, provide the classroom or supervised practical training required for qualification as a certified home health aide. The bill would require an online or distance learning training program for home health aide certification or in-service training for certified home health aides to include specific requirements, including, among others, requiring a trainee to sign an affidavit attesting under penalty of perjury to confirm their identity while completing the program. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require these training programs, among other things, to allow the department access to monitor online or distance learning sessions. This bill would require a certified home health aide, seeking to renew their unexpired certificate, to submit evidence of completing at least 12 hours of in-service training during each 12-month period of the certification. By expanding the duties on home health agencies, applicants for certification as a certified home health aide, or certified home health aides, this bill would expand an existing crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
