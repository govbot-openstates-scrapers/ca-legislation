Existing law requires these awards to be let to the most responsive and responsible party, and further requires that price be the primary consideration, but not the only determining factor.\n\nThis bill would eliminate the requirement that price be the primary consideration, but not the only determining factor. The bill would also modify the specified federal procurement standards a school district is required to be consistent with when making procurement bid solicitations and awards."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
