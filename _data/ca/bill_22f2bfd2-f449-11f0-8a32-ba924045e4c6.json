{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB127", "title": "Climate change.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Climatechange"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) under the direction of a chairperson. Existing law provides an annual salary for members and for the chairperson and prescribes a method by which those salaries may be increased.\n\nExisting law grants an additional salary increase of 5% in each of the 2023\u201324, 2024\u201325, and 2025\u201326 fiscal years for members of the Energy Commission.\n\nThis bill would, similarly, grant the chairperson of the Energy Commission an additional salary increase of 5% for the 2025\u201326, 2026\u201327, and 2027\u201328 fiscal years.\n\nExisting law requires the Energy Commission to develop and implement the Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program to award moneys for projects that will benefit electricity ratepayers, lead to technological advancement and breakthroughs, and result in a portfolio of projects that is strategically focused and sufficiently narrow to make advancement on the most significant technological challenges, as specified. Existing law, until July 1, 2025, authorizes the Energy Commission to award, through a noncompetitive method, follow-on funding for projects that meet specified criteria, including the EPIC program's eligibility requirements and that the projects have been funded, at least in part, through the EPIC program. \n\nThis bill would extend the authorization to award follow-on funding for those projects until January 1, 2028.\n\nExisting law vests the Energy Commission with the exclusive jurisdiction to certify the construction of stationary or floating electrical generating facilities using a source of thermal energy with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more and prohibits a person from constructing those facilities unless that person obtains a certificate from the commission, as provided. Existing law establishes an opt-in certification process, as provided, for solar photovoltaic, terrestrial wind electrical generation powerplants, and thermal powerplants that do not use fossil or nuclear fuels, with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more, an energy storage system capable of storing 200 megawatthours or more of electricity, or projects associated with the manufacture, production, or assembly of energy storage systems, wind systems, solar photovoltaic energy systems, or specialized products, components, or systems integral to renewable energy or energy storage technologies, that authorizes a person proposing to construct those facilities to file an application for certification with the Energy Commission. Existing law requires a person submitting an application for certification to submit a fee of $250,000 plus $500 per megawatt of gross generating capacity or per megawatthour of gross energy storage capacity, or $0.70 per square foot of those manufacturing, production, or assembly facilities. Existing law prohibits the application fee from exceeding $750,000. Existing law requires a person receiving a certification from the Energy Commission to pay an annual fee of $25,000 for each year the facility retains its certification. Existing law requires a person submitting a petition to amend an existing project that previously received certification to submit with the petition a fee of $5,000. Existing law requires that those fees be adjusted annually, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead require a person submitting an application for certification to submit with the application a nonrefundable deposit of $750,000 and would require the applicant to pay all costs incurred by the Energy Commission in processing the application. The bill would require the Energy Commission to provide invoices for additional fees, at least annually, for the actual costs incurred by the Energy Commission in excess of the deposit. The bill would increase the annual fee to $70,000 for each year the facility retains its certification. The bill would specify that the petition fee is nonrefundable.\n\nExisting law requires the Energy Commission to implement and administer the Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state's electrical grid during extreme events, and the Demand Side Grid Support Program to incentivize dispatchable customer load reduction and backup generation operation as on-call emergency supply and load reduction for the state's electrical grid during extreme events, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Water Resources, in consultation with the Energy Commission, to implement those projects, purchases, and contracts to carry out the above-described purposes. Existing law requires facilities constructed by the department, or under a contract with the department, that use any form of fossil fuel to be operated as necessary to respond to extreme events and prohibits those facilities from being operated any other time, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead require facilities constructed and owned by the department, rather than constructed by the department, or under a contract with the department, that use any form of fossil fuel to be operated as necessary to respond to extreme events and prohibit those facilities from being operated any other time, except as provided.\n\nExisting law, for the 2021\u201322 fiscal year, appropriates $200,000,000 to the Energy Commission to be used for a program to provide incentives for demand side grid support and associated mitigation costs and authorizes the expenditure of those moneys for the adoption of regulations, guidelines, or other standards for the program, third-party block grants or contracts with incentive program implementers for purposes of implementing the program, or advancing up to 25% of the awarded funds at a time to parties that are eligible for funding for purposes of the program.\n\nThis bill would authorize the use of any additional funding appropriated by the Legislature to the Energy Commission for demand side grid support and associated mitigation costs for the above-specified uses.\n\nExisting law establishes the Clean Transportation Program, administered by the Energy Commission, to provide funding to certain entities to develop and deploy innovative technologies that transform California's fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state's climate change policies. Existing law limits funding under the program to specified categories of programs and projects, including, among others, block grants or incentive programs administered by public entities or not-for-profit technology entities for multiple projects, education and program promotion within California, and development of zero-emission fuel and vehicle technology centers.\n\nThis bill would revise that category of programs and projects eligible for this funding by eliminating the restriction that the block grants or incentive programs be administered by public entities or not-for-profit technology entities and by expanding the category to authorize this funding for block grants or incentive programs for zero-emission vehicle infrastructure.\n\nExisting law requires the State Air Resources Board (state board) to adopt and implement motor vehicle emission standards. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board is subject to a civil penalty, and requires those penalties to be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund.\n\nExisting law authorizes the state board to adopt a schedule of annual fees for the certification, audit, and compliance of motor vehicles and engines sold in the state to cover the state board's reasonable costs in implementing the certification, audit, and compliance programs, and requires those fees be deposited in the Certification and Compliance Fund. Existing law authorizes the state board to adopt a schedule of fees to cover all or a portion of the state board's reasonable costs for the certification, audit, and compliance of off-road or nonvehicular engines and equipment, aftermarket parts, and emissions control components sold in the state, and requires all moneys collected by the state board as part of that schedule of fees to be deposited in the Certification and Compliance Fund.\n\nThis bill would also authorize the state board to adopt a schedule of annual fees for deficiencies of motor vehicles and engines sold in the state and a schedule of fees to cover all or a portion of the state board's reasonable costs for the deficiencies of off-road or nonvehicular engines and equipment, aftermarket parts, and emissions control components sold in the state. The bill would require the fees collected under both of those schedules to be deposited in the Certification and Compliance Fund.\n\nExisting law establishes the Charge Ahead California Initiative, administered by the state board, and with the goals of, among other things, placing in service at least 1,000,000 zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles by January 1, 2023, and increasing access for disadvantaged, low-income, and moderate-income communities and consumers to zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles. Existing law also establishes the Clean Cars 4 All Program, which is administered by the state board, to focus on achieving reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases, improvements in air quality, and benefits to low-income state residents through the replacement of high-polluter motor vehicles with cleaner and more efficient motor vehicles or a mobility option. Under existing law, the distribution of incentives under the program is implemented in air pollution control and air quality management districts that choose to participate in the program and through a statewide program. Existing law requires the state board, with respect to specified funds made available to the state board and that the state board allocated to the program, to maintain funding for each local air district participating in the program by requiring the state board to reallocate funds to local air districts under certain circumstances.\n\nThis bill would expand the requirement to maintain funding to local air districts in that manner using other specified funds made available to the state board for the suite of equity transportation programs established under the Charge Ahead California Initiative, including the Clean Cars 4 All Program.\n\nThis bill would appropriate the sum of $132,175,000 from the Air Pollution Control Fund to the State Air Resources Board for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, when funds are available from a specified consent decree, to be administered through the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, as specified. The bill would make the funds available for encumbrance or expenditure until June 30, 2027, and available for liquidation until June 30, 2029.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
