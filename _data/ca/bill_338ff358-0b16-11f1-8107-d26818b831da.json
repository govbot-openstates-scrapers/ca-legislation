Existing law authorizes one or more representative parties to bring suit for the benefit of a class of parties if the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.\n\nThis bill would authorize an employer to seek a workplace violence restraining order on behalf of a reasonably identifiable group or class of employees if a credible threat of violence is generally directed at the employer's workplace or at the employer's employees. The bill would not require an employer to name any individual employee as a protected party if the employer seeks a workplace violence restraining order on behalf of a group or class of employees."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
