The act defines \"investment\" to mean any financial interest in or security issued by a business entity, including, among other things, stocks and any partnership or other ownership interest owned by the public official or that person's immediate family, as specified. The act specifies that an asset is an investment only if its fair market value equals or exceeds $2,000. The act requires each public agency to adopt a conflict of interest code for designated employees of the agency.\n\nExisting law defines digital financial asset to mean a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and that is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender, subject to specified exceptions.\n\nThis bill, beginning January 1, 2027, would expand the definition of \"investment\" for purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 to include a digital financial asset, and would specifically require public officials to disclose interests in their digital financial assets, as specified. The bill would also require an agency's conflict of interest code to require designated employees to disclose interests in digital financial assets, as specified.\n\nExisting law makes a knowing or willful violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 a misdemeanor and subjects offenders to criminal penalties. By including additional assets that must be disclosed by public officials on statements of economic interest, the bill would expand the scope of a crime and impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
