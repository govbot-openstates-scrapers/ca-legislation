{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB925", "title": "Mobilehome parks: emergency preparedness.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Mobilehomeparks", "emergencypreparedness"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law, the Mobilehome Parks Act, generally regulates various classifications of mobilehome and related vehicle parks, and imposes enforcement duties on the Department of Housing and Community Development (department) and local enforcement agencies. Existing law makes it unlawful to operate a park without a valid permit issued by the enforcement agency. In this connection, existing law requires payment of an annual fee of $4 per lot at the time of payment of the annual operating permit fee that is used exclusively by the department or local enforcement agency for the inspection of mobilehome parks and mobilehomes to determine compliance with the act.\n\nThis bill would increase the per-lot fee to $10 until January 1, 2030.\n\n(2) Existing law requires every park with 50 or more units to have a person who is responsible for, and will respond in a timely manner to, emergencies concerning the operation and maintenance of the park that resides in the park and has knowledge of emergency procedures relative to utility systems and common facilities under the ownership and control of the owner of the park, and familiarity with the emergency preparedness plans for the park.\n\nThis bill would require the department, on or before June 30, 2026, to publicly post on its internet website changes to the provision described above that are to become operative on January 1, 2027. This bill would, starting January 1, 2027, require that in every park with 50 or more units, including special occupancy parks, a person be available who has knowledge of the emergency preparedness plan for the park and have access to utility systems, fire hydrants, and exits and entrances under the ownership or control of the park.\n\n(3) Existing law requires an owner or operator of an existing mobilehome park to adopt an emergency preparedness plan on or before September 1, 2010. For parks constructed after September 1, 2010, existing law requires an owner or operator of a park to adopt that plan before the issuance of the permit to operate. Existing law requires an owner or operator to post notice of the plan and provide information to residents relating to accessing the plan and individual emergency preparedness information, as specified. Existing law requires an enforcement agency to determine park compliance with these provisions. Existing law deems a violation of these provisions to constitute an unreasonable risk to life, health, or safety and requires correction by park management within 60 days of notice of the violation. Under existing law, a willful violation of the act is a misdemeanor, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, instead, require, beginning January 1, 2027, an owner or operator of a mobilehome park to adopt an emergency preparedness plan, which includes prescribed elements, before renewal of a permit to operate for an existing park, and before the issuance and renewal of a permit to operate for a park constructed after January 1, 2027. The bill would require a park to adopt emergency procedures and plans approved by the Standardized Emergency Management System Advisory Board, as specified, and a written statement by a park owner, manager, or designee that shall be attached to the park's request to obtain or renew a permit to operate. The bill would require an owner or operator of a park to provide notice annually on how to access the plan by distribution of the materials to each household and posting notice of the plan, as specified. The bill would require an enforcement agency to ascertain compliance with those provisions through specified methods, and to refuse to issue or renew a permit to operate if a violation is not corrected within 60 days of notice of the violation and would authorize the enforcement agency to impose formal penalties. The bill would require park management to make a subsequent written statement under penalty of perjury before the issuance and renewal of the park's permit to operate, if management does not correct the violation within 60 days of notice and formal penalties are issued by the enforcement agency.\n\nThe bill would also require the department to publicly post the above-described provisions on its internet website on or before June 30, 2026.\n\nBecause this bill would expand the crime of perjury and the scope of existing crimes under the Mobilehome Parks Act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
