The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws. Existing law imposes or dedicates certain state sales and use tax rates for local funding, including through the Local Revenue Fund 2011.\n\nExisting law provides various exemptions from the taxes imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law, including, until July 1, 2030, a partial exemption for the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, qualified tangible personal property, as defined, purchased by a qualified person, as defined, for purchases not exceeding $200,000,000, primarily used for specified purposes, including manufacturing, recycling, and research and development. Existing sales and use tax law provides that the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law, the Transactions and Use Tax Law, and those laws imposing certain sales and use tax rates for local funding do not apply to the above-described exemption, thereby subjecting the sale, or the storage, use, or other consumption in this state, of tangible personal property, otherwise exempt from taxation under these provisions, to local sales and use taxes, transactions and use taxes, and state sales and use taxes imposed for local funding.\n\nThis bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, allow a credit against the taxes imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law to a taxpayer in an amount equal to the amount of sales tax reimbursement paid by the taxpayer to a retailer for the purchase of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state, or the amount of use tax paid by the taxpayer on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer, that would have been exempt from taxation pursuant to the above-described exemption, but for the application of local sales and use taxes and transactions and use taxes, or the imposition of certain sales and use tax rates for local funding, as specified. The bill would authorize the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to provide specified information to the Franchise Tax Board to assist in the administration of the credit, and would apply existing restrictions to the sharing of that information, the violation of which is a crime. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThis bill would require, on or before May 14, 2026, and annually thereafter, the Department of Finance to provide to the legislative budget committees an estimate of the amount of revenue that would not be realized if the credits described above were allowed for that taxable year and would provide that those credits are allowed only for taxable years for which the Legislature appropriates money in the Budget Act for the administration of those credits. \n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Personal income taxes: credit: research and development."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
