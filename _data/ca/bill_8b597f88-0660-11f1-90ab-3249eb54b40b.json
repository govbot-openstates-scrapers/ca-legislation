Existing law requires the owner, the owner's agent, or the person in lawful possession to make a separate request to the peace officer on each occasion when the peace officer's assistance in dealing with a trespass is requested, except that a single request for peace officer assistance may be made for a period not to exceed 12 months when there is a fire hazard to the premises or property, the owner is absent from the premises or property, or the premises or property is closed to the public and posted as being closed. Existing law requires the requester to inform the law enforcement agency to which the request was made when the assistance is no longer desired before the 12-month period expires. Existing law also authorizes a single request for assistance to be made and submitted electronically, in a notarized form provided by the law enforcement agency, to a peace officer, and authorizes local governments to accept electronic submissions of requests for peace officer assistance.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the submitted form described above be notarized. The bill would extend the maximum period of time for a request for peace officer assistance from 12 months to 3 years for requests pertaining to a fire hazard, the owner's absence, or the property being closed to the public."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
