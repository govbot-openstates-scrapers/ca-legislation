Existing law also establishes the Department of Housing and Community Development in the agency and makes the department responsible for administering various housing programs throughout the state, including, among others, the Multifamily Housing Program, the Housing for a Healthy California Program, and the California Emergency Solutions Grants Program.\n\nThis bill would enact the California Housing Justice Act of 2025, which would require the department to create, by January 1, 2028, and in collaboration with specified entities, including local entities, finance plans to solve homelessness and to solve the housing unaffordability crisis, and related statewide performance metrics. By imposing additional duties on local entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require the agency, on or before October 1, 2028, to report to the Legislature on the finance plans and performance metrics described above, and to publish goals on its internet website and update any progress toward the goals. The bill would also make related findings and declarations.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
