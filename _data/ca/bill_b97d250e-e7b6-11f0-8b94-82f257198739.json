{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1372", "title": "Renewable electrical generation facilities: electrified commuter railroads: regenerative braking: net billing.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Renewableelectricalgenerationfacilities", "electrifiedcommuterrailroads", "netbilling", "regenerativebraking"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law requires every electric utility, except as provided, to develop a standard contract or tariff providing for net energy metering, and to make this standard contract or tariff available to eligible customer-generators using renewable electrical generation facilities, as specified. Pursuant to its authority, the commission issued a decision revising net energy metering tariff and subtariffs, commonly known as the net billing tariff.\n\nThis bill would include the regenerative braking from electric trains as a renewable electrical generation facility for those purposes, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes a community choice aggregator to aggregate the electrical load of interested electricity consumers within its boundaries and requires the community choice aggregator to, among other things, enter into an operating service agreement with an electrical corporation.\n\nThis bill would, upon an electrical corporation, electric service provider, or community choice aggregator and an operator of an electrified commuter railroad that produces electricity through the regenerative braking of electric trains, including the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, completing certain technical studies, require the electrical corporation, electric service provider, or community choice aggregator to adopt or modify a net billing contract or tariff that is approved by the commission or the appropriate rate approving entity, as provided. The bill would require that contract or tariff to, among other things, require the supplier or distributor to apply bill credits for the electricity exported to the electrical grid based on its value, as specified. The bill would require the load-serving entity responsible for the delivery of electricity to provide, or install at its cost, if necessary, metering that records and documents electricity imports and exports, as specified.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Electricity: electrified commuter railroads: regenerative braking: net energy."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
