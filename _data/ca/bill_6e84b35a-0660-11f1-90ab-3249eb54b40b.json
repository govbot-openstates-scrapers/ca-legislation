Existing law states that the University of California has exclusive jurisdiction in public higher education over, among others, instruction in the profession of law. \n\nThis bill would authorize the Trustees of the California State University to establish a legal education pilot program, consisting of the California State University, San Jose, and a law school accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California as an independent nonprofit institution, to operate for a period of 6 academic years. The bill would require the legal education pilot program to commence only if the trustees approve the program, the governing board of the law school approves the program, and the law school has been continuously accredited for a minimum of 5 years before the first cohort graduates from a joint degree program. The bill would authorize the California State University, San Jose, as part of the legal education pilot program, to partner with the nonprofit law school to jointly award a juris doctor degree and to jointly provide certificate and legal education programs at the undergraduate level. The bill would require the California State University, San Jose, and the nonprofit law school to submit certain information, including an administrative plan and enrollment projections, to the trustees and the governing board of the law school before the trustees and governing board vote to approve the pilot program. The bill would require the Legislative Analyst's Office to conduct an interim evaluation and a final evaluation of the program, as provided.\n\nThis bill would make these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2041, and would repeal it as of January 1, 2042.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the California State University, San Jose."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California State University, San Jose: law school."}, {"note": "", "title": "Apprenticeship: annual report: task force."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
