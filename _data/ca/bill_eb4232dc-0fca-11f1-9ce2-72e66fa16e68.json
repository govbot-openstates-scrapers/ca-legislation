A violation of provisions relating to these facilities is a misdemeanor. Existing law defines a children's crisis residential program to mean a facility licensed as a short-term residential therapeutic program and approved by the State Department of Health Care Services, or a county mental health plan, to operate a children's crisis residential mental health program to serve children experiencing mental health crises as an alternative to psychiatric hospitalization. \n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation regarding transportation services transporting minors from their home to a residential care facility or a short-term residential therapeutic program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
