The MTA defines \"money transmission\" to mean, among other things, selling or issuing stored value to a person located in the state and defines \"stored value\" to mean monetary value representing a claim against the issuer that is stored on an electronic or digital medium and evidenced by an electronic or digital record and that is intended and accepted for use as a means of redemption for money or monetary value or payment for goods or services. The MTA punishes noncompliance with, among other things, a civil penalty, license revocation, and, for certain violations, as a felony, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would prohibit, beginning January 1, 2028, under the act, a digital wallet provider or money transmitter operating in the state from allowing a user to log in without using two-factor authentication or multifactor authentication for any login by that user. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Digital wallets: security."}, {"note": "", "title": "Money Transmission Act: stored value platforms: fraudulently induced transfers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
