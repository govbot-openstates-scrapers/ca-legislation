Existing law requires the board to segregate the moneys coming into the ABLE program trust into 2 funds: the program fund, which is continuously appropriated, for specified purposes of the act, and the administrative fund, which is available upon appropriation by the Legislature for administration of the act. Existing law requires all moneys paid by designated beneficiaries or eligible individuals in connection with ABLE accounts to be deposited, as received, into the program fund, promptly invested, and accounted for separately. Existing law grants the board the power to accept grants, gifts, appropriations, and other moneys from any unit of federal, state, or local government, among other specified entities, for deposit to specified funds.\n\nThis bill would authorize the California ABLE Act Board to additionally accept grants, gifts, legislative appropriations, and other moneys from a philanthropic entity, and would specify that the program can receive legislative appropriations. The bill would authorize the board to target specific subgroups of eligible individuals, as specified, and would authorize the board to use those moneys received to encourage eligible individuals to create an ABLE account or maximize account participation by engaging public awareness about the program. By authorizing new uses of moneys in a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to include, on a taxpayer's form instructions for filing a return, information about the ability of a taxpayer to directly deposit a portion of their refund into the Golden State Scholarshare College Savings Trust, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the Franchise Tax Board to include, on a taxpayer's form instructions for filing a return, information about the ability of a taxpayer to directly deposit a portion of their refund into the California ABLE Program Trust."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
