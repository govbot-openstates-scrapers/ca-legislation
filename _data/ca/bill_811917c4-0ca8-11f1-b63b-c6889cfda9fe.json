Existing law requires the Intersegmental Committee of the Academic Senates of the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges to establish a singular lower division general education pathway that meets the academic requirements necessary for transfer admission to both the California State University and the University of California. Existing law, commencing with the fall term of the 2025\u201326 academic year, requires that singular lower division general education pathway to be the only lower division general education pathway used to determine academic eligibility and sufficient academic preparation for transfer into the California State University and the University of California, as specified.\n\nProvisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act apply to the University of California only to the extent that the Regents of the University of California act, by resolution, to make them applicable.\n\nThis bill would require, for purposes of the above-described eligibility requirement for transfer to a California State University baccalaureate program, a student to complete the California General Education Transfer Curriculum, established pursuant to the above requirements, commencing in the fall term of the 2025\u201326 academic year, instead of the IGETC or the California State University General Education-Breadth Requirements. The bill would deem a student who is placed on the IGETC or the California State University General Education-Breadth Requirements before the fall term of the 2025\u201326 academic year and completes the pattern with appropriate certification to have met that requirement. The bill would also make conforming changes by replacing references to the IGETC or the California State University General Education-Breadth Requirements with a reference to the California General Education Transfer Curriculum.\n\n(2) Existing law requires funds appropriated to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for the Foster Care Education Program to be used for foster parent and relative/kinship care provider education, as specified.\n\nThis bill would rename the program the Foster and Kinship Care Education Program and would instead require funds appropriated for the program to be used for education for resource families, as defined."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
