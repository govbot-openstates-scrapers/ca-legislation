Existing law describes the affirmative standard characteristics that, if lacking, make a dwelling untenantable. Existing law requires a city or county that receives a complaint from a tenant, resident, or occupant that a building contains lead hazards or is substandard to perform an inspection of the building or portion thereof intended for human occupancy, document any violations, advise the owner or operator of each violation and of each action that is required to be taken to remedy the violation, and schedule a reinspection to verify correction of the violations, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize the landlord of a dwelling unit to elect to have an inspection performed to verify that the dwelling unit satisfies the habitability requirements described above before it is made available for hire. Because the bill would require local agencies to provides additional services, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would establish a presumption that, if the landlord has an inspection performed showing no violation of the habitability requirements, the dwelling unit meets that standard for an unspecified period of time. If a tenant makes the landlord aware of a dilapidation of the premises during that time, the bill would provide the landlord an unspecified period of time in which to cure or correct the dilapidation, during which period the landlord would not be deemed to be in violation of the habitability requirements described above. The bill would authorize a local agency that performs an inspection at the request of a landlord to charge the landlord a fee sufficient to cover its cost in providing the inspection.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Tenancy."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
