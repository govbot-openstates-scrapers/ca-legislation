The act requires the department to deposit those amounts into the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. The act requires the fund to be continuously appropriated to the department for specified purposes, including, among other things, to pay refund values, administrative fees, and processing payments associated with the collection and recycling of empty beverage containers. The act continuously appropriates up to $15,000,000 annually from the fund to the department for quality incentive payments for empty glass beverage containers to an operator of a curbside recycling program or other certified entity, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize the department to make quality incentive payments from the fund to other entities, including, but not limited to, manufacturers of fiberglass insulation in this state that use glass cullet, as specified.
