Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to maximize all available food choices for CalFresh recipients, as specified. \n\nExisting law requires the State Department of Public Health to adopt regulations, on or before June 1, 2028, to define \"ultraprocessed foods of concern\" and, when defining the term, to consider specified factors, including, among others, whether, based on reputable peer-reviewed scientific evidence, a substance or group of substances are linked to health harms or adverse health consequences.\n\nThis bill, the SNAP to Thrive: Shop Nutritiously and Preventatively to Thrive Act, notwithstanding the requirement to maximize food choices, would require the State Department of Social Services on or before July 1, 2027, to seek a federal waiver from the United States Department of Agriculture to prohibit CalFresh recipients from using CalFresh benefits to purchase soft drinks, candy, and prepackaged desserts, as defined. If a food product is determined to be an ultraprocessed food of concern, as described above, the bill would require the State Department of Social Services to seek a federal waiver from the United States Department of Agriculture to prohibit CalFresh recipients from using CalFresh benefits to purchase that food product. Upon receipt of a waiver granted by the United States Department of Agriculture for purposes of prohibiting the purchase of soft drinks, candy, prepackaged desserts, or ultraprocessed foods of concern, the bill would require the State Department of Social Services to implement the prohibitions granted within 6 months."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
