Existing law prohibits a person from filing more than 2 small claims actions in any calendar year in which the amount demanded exceeds $2,500, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would increase the small claims court jurisdiction over actions brought by a natural person, except as specified, and other specified actions within the jurisdiction of the small claims court if the amount does not exceed $15,000.
