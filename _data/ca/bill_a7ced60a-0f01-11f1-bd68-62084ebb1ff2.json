Existing law generally requires a local agency, before disposing or negotiating to dispose of surplus land, to provide a written notice of the availability of the surplus land to specified entities and housing sponsors. Under existing law, land declared by an agency of the state or any local agency as \"exempt surplus land\" is not subject to these requirements.\n\nThis bill would exempt lands that comprise Mission Bay Park, as defined and located within the City of San Diego, as specified, from these requirements.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Mission Bay Park."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
