Existing law requires a county elections official to provide a facsimile copy of the ballot with the ballot measures and ballot instructions printed in languages other than English if the Secretary of State has determined that doing so is appropriate, as specified. \n\nThis bill would require elections officials to provide a voter with registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, in Bengali if the voter requests it. By increasing duties on local elections officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
