Existing law repeals the act on January 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would extend operation of the act until an unspecified date.\n\n Existing law defines naturopathic medicine and authorizes a naturopathic doctor to perform specific health care functions. Existing law authorizes a naturopathic doctor to dispense, administer, order, prescribe, and furnish or perform, among other things, repair and care incidental to superficial lacerations and abrasions, except suturing, and the removal of foreign bodies located in the superficial tissues. \n\nThis bill would, instead, authorize a naturopathic doctor to dispense, administer, order, prescribe, and furnish or perform minor office procedures, defined, in part, to mean care and operative procedures relative to lacerations, skin lesions, and abrasions, the incision and drainage of abscesses, and the trephination of subungual hematomas, among other specified procedures.\n\nExisting law authorizes a naturopathic doctor to furnish or order drugs, including Schedule III to Schedule V, inclusive, controlled substances, under specified circumstances, including, among others, that the drugs are furnished or ordered under the supervision of a physician and surgeon and in accordance with standardized procedures or protocols developed by the naturopathic doctor and their supervising physician and surgeon and that the board has certified that the naturopathic doctor has completed coursework in pharmacology, as specified. Existing law authorizes a naturopathic doctor to independently prescribe and administer other specified drugs.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast the above-described authorizations to instead authorize a naturopathic doctor to furnish, order, or prescribe drugs, including, among others, Schedule II to Schedule V, inclusive, controlled substances, and would remove the supervision and standardized procedure requirements. The bill would make conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced. To Com. on RLS. for assignment.
