Existing law requires a person who unlawfully withholds wages due an employee, as provided, to be subject to specified civil penalties. Existing law charges the Labor Commissioner with enforcement of these provisions.\n\nExisting law makes every person who fails to pay the wages of each employee subject to a specified penalty. Existing law requires the penalty to either be recovered by an employee as a statutory penalty or by the Labor Commissioner as a civil penalty, as prescribed.\n\nExisting law defines \"public works,\" for purposes of regulating public works contracts, as, among other things, construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for, in whole or in part, out of public funds. Existing law further requires that, except as specified, not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages be paid to workers employed on public works and imposes misdemeanor penalties for a violation of this requirement. Existing law provides that for the purposes of provisions of law relating to the payment of prevailing wages, \"public works\" includes specified types of construction, alteration, demolition, installation, and repair work.\n\nExisting law, the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, authorizes an aggrieved employee to recover through a civil action a civil penalty that may be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, until January 1, 2029, authorize a taxpayer, employer, contractor, or subcontractor to make an elective retroactive wage payment, as defined, to workers who performed work on a qualified renewable clean energy facility pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) if certain requirements are met, including, among others, that the facility is not a public works project, as defined, and would not otherwise be subject to the Davis-Bacon Act, as specified. The bill would specify that those provisions do not apply to, among others, violations of any other provision of law unrelated to the payment of retroactive prevailing wage correction payments in connection with the application for federal tax benefits pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The bill would limit that authorization to renewable energy facility construction or repairs commenced on or after January 1, 2023, that were completed on or before December 31, 2024.\n\nThe bill would make related findings and declarations.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Account: University of California: California State University: reports."}, {"note": "", "title": "High-Speed Rail Authority."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
