Existing law requires county elections officials to prepare a county voter information guide that contains, among other things, a substantial facsimile of the official ballot.\n\nThis bill would conform provisions in the Political Reform Act of 1974 that currently refer to the ballot pamphlet or sample ballot to instead refer to the state voter information guide or county voter information guide, respectively.\n\n(2) The Political Reform Act of 1974 authorizes a candidate for elective state, county, or city office to raise contributions for a general election before the primary election, and for a special general election before a special primary election, for the same office under specified conditions. If the candidate is defeated in the primary election or special primary election, or otherwise withdraws from the general election or special general election, the act requires the candidate to refund the general election or special general election funds, as specified.\n\nExisting law, for purposes of these provisions, specifies that a candidate who does not file a declaration of candidacy to qualify for a primary election or special primary election is not required to refund the general election or special general election contributions, and that such a candidate may transfer these funds to a committee for the same or a different office as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that a candidate is not required to refund the general election or special general election contributions and may transfer these funds, as specified above, if the candidate's name has not been listed on the ballot at a primary election or special primary election, and the candidate has not qualified to have write-in votes cast on their behalf, as specified.\n\n(3) This bill would also correct a cross-reference to federal law.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Voter information guide."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
