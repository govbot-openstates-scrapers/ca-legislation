{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB759", "title": "Architects: architects-in-training.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Architects", "architects-in-training"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Architects Practice Act, establishes the California Architects Board within the Department of Consumer Affairs for licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the practice of architecture, and defines the term \"architect\" for those purposes. That act requires an applicant for licensure as an architect to, among other things, take an examination. The act imposes various fees on licensees and applicants for a license, which are deposited in the California Architects Board Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.\n\nThis bill would authorize a person to apply to the board and obtain authorization to use the title \"architect-in-training\" after they have been identified as a candidate for licensure by the board and certain requirements are met, including that they successfully passed at least one division of the above-described examination. The bill would require, before the board approves an authorization to an applicant to use that title, the licensed architect who will be responsible for supervising the applicant while using the title to submit to the board a form agreeing to be responsible for the work to be performed by the applicant while using the title, as specified, and require a person using the title, if the licensed architect responsible for supervising the person while using the title changes, to notify the board of the change within 30 days of the change, as specified. The bill would authorize a person using the title, during any period in which the person is not under supervision of a licensed architect, to request the board to place their authorization to use the title on inactive status, as specified.\n\n The bill would prohibit the use of an abbreviation or derivative of that title, other than \"AIT,\" and would prohibit a person from using that title to independently offer or provide architectural services to the public. The bill would authorize the board to disclose a person's authorization to use that title to a member of the public upon request. The bill would provide that the use of that title in violation of these provisions may constitute unprofessional conduct and subject the user of the title to administrative action, including denial of a license. The bill would authorize the board to charge a reasonable fee to evaluate whether a person meets the requirements to use the title \"architect-in-training.\" By increasing moneys deposited into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\nThe bill would authorize a person to use the title \"architect-in-training\" for no more than 4 years after approval by the board. The bill would authorize a person to apply to the board and obtain authorization to use the title \"architect-in-training\" a 2nd time if the person has passed a division of the above-described exam in the 4 years immediately preceding the person's application. The bill would prohibit a person from applying to the board to use the title \"architect-in training\" on or after January 1, 2033.\n\nThe act authorizes the board, upon its own motion, and requires the board, upon the verified complaint in writing of any person, to investigate the actions of any architect. In this regard, the act authorizes the board to temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the license of any architect who is guilty of, or commits one or more of, certain acts or omissions constituting grounds for disciplinary action under the act, including the conviction of a crime substantially related to the qualifications, functions, and duties of an architect by the holder of a license.\n\nThis bill would authorize the board, upon its own initiative or upon the receipt of a complaint, to investigate the actions of any person using the title \"architect-in-training\" as described above, and to make findings for those purposes. In this regard, the bill would authorize the board to suspend or revoke an active authorization to use the title \"architect-in-training\" for certain reasons, including that the person using the title committed any act of fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in obtaining the authorization to use that title.\n\nThe bill would specify that a licensed architect who is responsible for supervising a person using the title \"architect-in-training\" as described above is subject to disciplinary actions for any violations of the act committed by the person using that title within the course and scope of their employment.\n\nThe bill would make its provisions operative on January 1, 2027, and would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2037."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
