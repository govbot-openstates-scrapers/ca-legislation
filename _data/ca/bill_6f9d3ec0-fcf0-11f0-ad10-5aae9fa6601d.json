Pursuant to its authority, the state board has adopted regulations, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, which reduce emissions from passenger cars, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles sold in California, including a requirement that 100% of new vehicle sales be zero emission by 2035.\n\nThis bill, the California Energy Consumer Freedom Act, would prohibit state agencies and local governments from adopting or enforcing a rule, regulation, resolution, or ordinance that directly or indirectly results in prohibiting the use of gas appliances in residential or nonresidential buildings, and the buying, selling, or use of gasoline-powered vehicles or equipment.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Energy: gas stoves."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
