Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law sets forth specified prior authorization limitations for health care service plans and health insurers.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027, that provides coverage for physical therapy from imposing prior authorization for the initial 12 physical therapy treatment visits for a new condition. The bill would authorize prior authorization for physical therapy for a recurring condition, as specified. The bill would require a physical therapy provider to verify an enrollee's or an insured's coverage and disclose their share of the cost of care, as specified. The bill would require a physical therapy provider to obtain separate written consent for costs that may not be covered by the enrollee's or insured's plan contract or policy, that includes a written estimate of the cost of care for which the enrollee or insured is responsible if coverage is denied or otherwise not applicable. With respect to health care service plans, the bill would specify that its provisions do not apply to Medi-Cal managed care plan contracts. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Hazardous waste: facilities: permits."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
