Existing law vests PERB with jurisdiction to enforce certain provisions related to the authority's employees, over charges of unfair practices for represented authority employees, subject to a selection by an exclusive representative. Existing law, in the case of such a selection, gives PERB jurisdiction over the initial determination as to whether those charges are justified and, if so, the appropriate remedy, subject to certain restrictions.\n\nThis bill would authorize any charging party, respondent, or intervenor aggrieved by a final decision or order of PERB in an unfair practice case, except a decision of PERB not to issue a complaint in such a case, to petition for a writ of extraordinary relief from that decision or order, as specified. The bill, if the time to petition for extraordinary relief from a PERB decision or order has expired, would authorize PERB to seek enforcement of any final decision or order in a district court of appeal or superior court having jurisdiction over the county where the events giving rise to the decision or order occurred, as specified.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the authority."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State employees: Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority: employee relations."}, {"note": "", "title": "Public employees."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
