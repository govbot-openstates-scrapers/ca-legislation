Existing law requires a criminal record check of applicants for a license, special permit, or certificate of approval for a foster family home or certified family home, and other persons, including nonclients who reside in those homes and staff and employees. Existing law requires the department to check the child abuse and neglect registry of a different state for a licensee of a community care facility who has lived in another state in the preceding 5 years. Existing law generally makes violations of these requirements a crime.\n\nThis bill would authorize a licensee of a community care facility to approve an individual to care for children before the completion of another state's child abuse and neglect registry check if certain specified conditions are met, including that the community care facility has submitted a request for the out-of-state abuse and neglect registry check to the department. The bill would require a licensee to remove an applicant from the community care facility immediately upon receipt of information that would disqualify the applicant from approval and notify the department of the removal within 3 business days. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
