Existing law requires the department to issue a special permit, in addition to a license, to a health facility to offer one or more special services, such as an emergency center, if specified requirements are met, including that the department finds that the standards of care and services are adequate and appropriate.\n\nExisting law requires the department to issue a special permit to allow a general acute care hospital to offer emergency stabilization services at a location that is neither inside nor contiguous to the applicant hospital if the hospital provides satisfactory evidence to the department that, among other things, the hospital has a written transfer agreement with the hospital closest to the location where emergency stabilization services will be provided and satisfactory evidence to the department that this location meets certain requirements, including that the location is in the town of Paradise within the County of Butte and serves the same area previously served by Feather River Hospital.\n\nThis bill would require the department to issue a special permit, as specified, similar to the one issued above to allow a general acute care hospital to offer emergency stabilization services at a location that is neither inside nor contiguous to the applicant hospital if the hospital provides satisfactory evidence to the department that, among other things, the hospital has a written transfer agreement with the hospital closest to the location where emergency stabilization services will be provided and satisfactory evidence to the department that this location meets certain requirements, including that the location is in the City of Patterson in the County of Stanislaus and serves the same general population as is served by Del Puerto Health Care District.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Patterson in the County of Stanislaus."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
