Existing law authorizes a conservator to authorize the placement of a conservatee in a secured perimeter residential care facility for the elderly upon a court making specific findings.\n\nThis bill would also authorize a conservator to authorize the placement of a conservatee in a residential facility, an intermediate care facility, or a skilled nursing facility, as defined, that has a secured perimeter, a delayed egress device, or both a secured perimeter and a delayed egress device, as specified. The bill would require court approval for a subsequent placement of a conservatee in a different facility if specific regulations have not been promulgated for the type of facility to which the conservator is seeking to move the conservatee. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Public Health to update their regulations related to these provisions, including, among other things, to create regulations to protect the rights, health, and safety of residents, by January 1, 2027, and would authorize those departments to promulgate emergency regulations prior to that date."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
