Existing law finds and declares that direct service professionals are critical to the provision of services and supports to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law requires the department to develop or utilize existing curriculum to implement enhanced direct service professional training that promotes services that are person centered and culturally and linguistically sensitive, and that improve outcomes for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nThis bill would change the title of direct service professionals to instead be direct support professionals, and would define that latter term as an individual who receives compensation to provide direct support to children or adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, is employed by a service provider receiving regional center funding, and spends at least 50% of their working time completing direct support tasks, as specified. The bill would require the department to, on or before April 1, 2027, and subject to an appropriation of funds for this purpose in the annual Budget Act, develop the billing guidance necessary to facilitate a pay differential associated with the above-described training. The bill would also make various technical, conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
