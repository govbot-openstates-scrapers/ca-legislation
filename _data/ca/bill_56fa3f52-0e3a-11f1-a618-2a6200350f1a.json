Existing law requires the specifications to be based on standards developed by the Department of Transportation for recycled paving materials and for recycled base, subbase, and pervious backfill materials.\n\nExisting law requires a local agency that has jurisdiction over a street or highway, to the extent feasible and cost effective, to apply standard specifications that allow for the use of recycled materials in streets and highways, except as provided. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2027, those standard specifications to allow recycled materials at or above the level allowed in the Department of Transportation's standard specifications that went into effect on October 22, 2018, for specified materials.\n\nThis bill would indefinitely require a local agency's standard specifications to allow recycled materials at a level no less than the level allowed in the department's specifications for those specified materials. If a local agency's standard specifications do not allow for the use of recycled materials at a level that is equal to or greater than the level allowed in the department's standard specifications on the basis that the use of those recycled materials at those levels is not feasible, the bill would authorize a person bidding on a contract to supply materials subject to those specifications to request the local agency to provide the reason for that determination upon request and would require the local agency to respond to that request, as specified. By increasing the duties of local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Transportation and a local agency that has jurisdiction over a street or highway, to the extent feasible and cost effective, to use advanced technologies and material recycling techniques that reduce the cost of maintaining and rehabilitating streets and highways and that exhibit reduced levels of greenhouse gas emissions through material choice and construction method.\n\nThis bill would eliminate this requirement.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
