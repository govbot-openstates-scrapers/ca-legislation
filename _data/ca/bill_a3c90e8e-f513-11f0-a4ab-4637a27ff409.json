{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1366", "title": "Reimbursement for pharmacist services.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Reimbursementforpharmacistservices"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which health care services are provided to low-income individuals pursuant to a schedule of benefits. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Under existing law, pharmacist services are a benefit under the Medi-Cal program, subject to federal approval, and the rate of reimbursement for pharmacist services is 85% of the fee schedule for physician services, except for medication therapy management (MTM) pharmacist services. Existing law requires the department to implement an MTM reimbursement methodology relating to the dispensing of qualified specialty drugs by an eligible contracting pharmacy, which would be intended to supplement Medi-Cal payments to eligible pharmacies for MTM pharmacist services provided in conjunction with certain specialty drug therapy categories.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the rate of reimbursement for advanced practice pharmacist services to be the same as the fee schedule for physician services, including MTM pharmacist services. The bill would require the department to implement an MTM reimbursement methodology relating to the use of drugs to ensure that Medi-Cal payments are only made to eligible advanced practice pharmacists or pharmacies for MTM pharmacist services provided in conjunction with certain specialty drug therapy categories.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care, and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan or disability insurer that offers coverage for pharmacist services to pay or reimburse the cost of the service performed by a pharmacist at an in-network pharmacy or a pharmacist at an out-of-network pharmacy if the insurer has an out-of-network pharmacy benefit. Existing law authorizes this payment or reimbursement when specified conditions are met, including that the coverage otherwise provides reimbursement for identical services performed by other licensed health care providers.\n\nThis bill would additionally require those health care service plans and disability insurers to pay or reimburse the cost of the service performed by an advanced practice pharmacist enrolled as a provider with the plan or insurer. The bill would authorize payment or reimbursement if the coverage otherwise provides reimbursement for similar services performed by other licensed health care providers, among other requirements. Because a willful violation of the bill's requirements relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "The Pharmacy Law."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
