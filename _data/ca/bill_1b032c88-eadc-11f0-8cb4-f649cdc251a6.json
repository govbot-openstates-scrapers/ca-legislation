Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst's Office, to conduct a study of the effects of enacting, in future legislation, a Pay it Forward, Pay it Back Pilot Program that would allow students to enroll at a California State University or University of California campus without paying upfront tuition, fees, or room and board, and instead would require participating students to pay, upon graduation or disenrollment and employment, a percentage of their annual adjusted gross income to the state for a number of years, as specified. The bill would require the commission to submit a report on the study of the pilot program to the Assembly Committee on Higher Education and the Senate Committee on Education on or before September 30, 2027.
