Existing law requires a county that utilizes a child advocacy center to meet specified standards, including, among other things, that the children's advocacy center must verify that interviews conducted in the course of investigations are conducted in a forensically sound manner and occur in a child-focused setting designed to provide a safe, comfortable, and dedicated place for children and families. Existing law requires the children's advocacy center or other identified multidisciplinary team member custodian to ensure that all recordings of child forensic interviews be released only in response to a court order, or, upon request, to law enforcement agencies authorized to investigate child abuse or agencies authorized to prosecute juvenile or criminal conduct described in the forensic interview, or to county counsel evaluating an allegation of child abuse.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the children's advocacy center or other identified multidisciplinary team member custodian to release a recording, upon request, to child welfare agencies authorized to investigate child abuse and neglect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
