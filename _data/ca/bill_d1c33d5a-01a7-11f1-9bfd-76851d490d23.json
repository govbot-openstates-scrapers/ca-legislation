Existing law generally regulates the obligations of owners with respect to real property.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a business entity, as defined, that has an interest in more than 1,000 single-family residential properties from purchasing, acquiring, or otherwise obtaining an ownership interest in another single-family residential property and subsequently leasing the property, as specified. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil action for a violation of these provisions, and would require a court in a civil action in which the Attorney General prevails to order specified relief, including that the business entity pay a civil penalty of $100,000 for each violation and that the business entity sell the property to an independent third party within one year of the date that the court enters judgment. The bill would require that these provisions be the exclusive means of enforcement of these provisions.
