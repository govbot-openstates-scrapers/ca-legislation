Existing law requires those law enforcement agencies to install and maintain records needed for the correct reporting of statistical data and to report the data to the Attorney General in the manner the Attorney General prescribes. Existing law requires the department to include information concerning arrests for human trafficking and the number of individuals who have been a victim of human trafficking, as reported through the California Incident-Based Reporting System, in the information made available on the OpenJustice Web portal. \n\nThis bill would require that the information included on the OpenJustice Web portal include the number of individuals arrested, the number of individuals convicted, and the number of victims of human trafficking, as specified. Because the bill would require local law enforcement agencies to collect and report additional information to the Attorney General, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
