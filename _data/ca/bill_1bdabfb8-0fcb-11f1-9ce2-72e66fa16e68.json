Under existing law, the protective order may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court.\n\nThis bill would authorize those orders to be valid for up to 10 years, or 2 years after the person's release from the state prison or a county jail, whichever is later.\n\nBy extending the duration of protective orders, a violation of which is punishable as a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
