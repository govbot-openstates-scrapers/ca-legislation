Existing law requires the 5 city council members to be selected by city selection committees representing the cities of that supervisorial district. Existing law provides for the members of the governing board to receive compensation while attending meetings of the district governing board or while on official business of the district and to receive the actual and necessary expenses incurred in performing the member's official duties, as specified.\n\nThis bill would provide that the members selected by the city selection committee members may be either a mayor or city council member from the applicable supervisorial district.\n\nThe bill would authorize each appointing authority to designate an alternate member to serve in place of the regular member when the regular member is absent or disqualified from participating and would require the alternate member to meet the same qualifications applicable to the regular member. When serving in place of the appointed member, the bill would authorize the alternate member to vote and to receive compensation and expenses, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires each member of the district to serve a 4-year term, as specified.\n\nThe bill would. require, on the first board meeting in the 2029 calendar year, the governing board clerk to conduct a random drawing to select 2 members appointed by city selection committee members and 2 public members to serve a 2-year term and until that member's successor is appointed.\n\nExisting law requires governing board of the district to designate one member representing the board of supervisors to serve as the liaison to the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Coast Guard.\n\nThis bill would eliminate the restriction that the member serving as the liaison be a member representing the board of supervisors and would require that member to be appointed as the liaison after consultation with the United States Armed Forces."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
