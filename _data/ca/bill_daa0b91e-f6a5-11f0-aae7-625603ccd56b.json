Existing law, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an initiative measure approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA.\n\nThis bill would require a social media platform to provide a clear and conspicuous button that enables the user to delete their account and provide the user with the necessary steps to delete the user's account and personal information if the user clicks on that button, in accordance with specified procedures. The bill would prohibit a social media platform from obstructing or interfering with a user's ability to delete their account, as specified.
