{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB506", "title": "Transportation: omnibus bill.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Transportation", "omnibusbill"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law establishes the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning, developing, and delivering cost-effective and responsive transit connectivity between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District's rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail service in the Tri-Valley that meets the goals and objectives of the community, as specified. Existing law requires the authority's governing board to be composed of 15 representatives.\n\nThe bill would replace the Mountain House Community Services District with the City of Mountain House on the authority's governing board.\n\n(2) Existing law, the Treasure Island Transportation Management Act, authorizes the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco to designate a board or agency to act as the transportation management agency for Treasure Island, defined to also include Yerba Buena Island. Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, by a 23 majority vote of both bodies, to adopt a program of imposing congestion pricing fees for motor vehicles exiting and entering Treasure Island and an initial congestion pricing fee structure, as specified. Existing law requires that, once adopted, the congestion pricing program may only be terminated by the recommendation of both the Treasure Island Development Authority and the Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency followed by a 23 majority vote of both the board of supervisors and the transportation authority. Prior to imposing the initial congestion pricing fees, existing law requires the board of supervisors and transportation authority to each make a finding of fact by a 23 majority vote that the congestion pricing fees have a relationship or benefit to the motor vehicle drivers who are paying the fee.\n\nThis bill would delete references to the San Francisco County Transportation Authority from the provisions described above, thereby removing those duties from the transportation authority. The bill would also make conforming changes.\n\n(3) Existing law requires that each application for an original or a renewal of a driver's license contain certain information, including the applicant's true full name, age, mailing address, and gender. Existing law also provides that if a driver's license is lost, destroyed, or mutilated, or if a new true full name is acquired, the person to whom the driver's license was issued shall obtain a duplicate if the person provides satisfactory proof of the loss, destruction, or mutilation. A violation of these provisions is an infraction.\n\nThis bill would authorize a person who submits a change of address, as specified, to apply for a duplicate driver's license. The bill would require the applicant who receives a duplicate through this process to immediately destroy the license containing the prior mailing address. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law generally prohibits any person from driving any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied in or upon the vehicle that obstructs or reduces the driver's clear view through the windshield or side windows. Existing law provides exceptions to this prohibition, including, among other things, a video event recorder in a commercial motor vehicle with the capability of monitoring driver performance to improve driver safety, as specified.\n\nThis bill would revise the above-described exception to instead apply to vehicle safety technology, as defined, installed on specified vehicles, including, among others, motortrucks of 3 or more axles that are more than 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, that are otherwise in compliance with federal regulations, as specified.\n\n(5) Existing law requires the Department of the California Highway Patrol to adopt reasonable rules and regulations that, in the judgment of the department, are designed to promote the safe operation of vehicles, including hours-of-service regulations for drivers of those vehicles that are consistent with specified federal hours-of-service regulations applicable to motor carriers. Existing law establishes exceptions to these regulations for vehicles engaged in intrastate commerce that are not transporting hazardous substances or hazardous waste, including a driver of a truck or truck tractor, except for a driver of a tank vehicle with a capacity of more than 500 gallons transporting flammable liquid, as specified. Existing law authorizes the department to create an exception for a driver, by regulation, of a tank vehicle with a capacity of more than 500 gallons to exceed the maximum driving time, provided that those regulations are consistent with federal laws and regulations, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor and for the purpose of refueling aircraft used in emergency-related activities.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that this exception be consistent with federal laws and regulations and would remove the requirement that the exception be limited to the driver of a tank vehicle with a capacity of more than 500 gallons. The bill would also make certain technical, nonsubstantive changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
