Existing law permits a portion of this continuing education to be completed either as self study or by providing pro bono spay or neuter services for specified agencies.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, instead, specify that both the self study and the pro bono spay or neuter services may be used to satisfy those requirements."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
