Under existing law, the use of a home as a small or large family daycare home is considered a residential use of property and a use by right for the purposes of all local ordinances, including zoning ordinances, and a local jurisdiction is prohibited from imposing a business license, fee, or tax for the privilege of operating a small or large family daycare home. Existing law also exempts small and large family daycare homes from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act.\n\nThis bill would similarly require a daycare center, as defined, when colocated with multifamily housing, to be considered a residential use of property and a use by right, as defined. The bill would similarly prohibit a local jurisdiction from imposing a charge, tax, or fee for a business license, equivalent instrument, or permit for the privilege of operating a daycare center that is colocated with multifamily housing.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
