The bill would also require every California internet service provider to make commercially reasonable efforts to promote and advertise the availability of affordable home internet service for eligible households, as provided.\n\nExisting law establishes within the Government Operations Agency the Department of Technology, which is supervised by the Director of Technology. Existing law authorizes the director and the department to exercise various powers in creating and managing the information technology policy of the state.\n\nThis bill would, starting January 1, 2027, require California internet service providers to annually provide a report to the Department of Technology with specified information related to their affordable home internet service plans.\n\nThis bill would provide that the Public Utilities Commission has no jurisdiction or regulatory authority to implement, enforce, interpret, or oversee any aspect of these provisions, as specified, and would require any administrative or oversight responsibilities to be carried out exclusively by the Department of Technology.\n\nThis bill would make its provisions inoperative upon the implementation of a federal or state broadband subscription subsidy program for low income households that meets specified criteria."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Communications: broadband internet service providers: affordable home internet."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
