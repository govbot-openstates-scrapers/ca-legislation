The bill would require a law enforcement agency that receives a complaint of a violation of these provisions to issue a citation and would provide a means for the person to show lawful entry on the land or premises. If court determines that the documentation showing lawful entry is improper or fraudulent, the bill would make the violation punishable by removal, specified fines, and as a misdemeanor. By increasing duties of local law enforcement and creating a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, with regard to certain mandates, no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Real property: unlawful detainer."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
