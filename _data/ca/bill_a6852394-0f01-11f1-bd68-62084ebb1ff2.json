The bill would increase the credit by 5% of qualified expenditures if the taxpayer purchases specified low-emission equipment or the qualified expenditures are related to the taxpayer's operations in a high or very high fire hazard severity zone, as specified. The bill would cap the aggregate amount of the credit allowed at $250,000,000 for each taxable year, and would require a taxpayer to request a credit reservation from the Department of Food and Agriculture, as provided. The bill would require the Department of Food and Agriculture to coordinate with the Franchise Tax Board for the administration of the credit. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board and the Department of Food and Agriculture to share specified information, and would make the unauthorized disclosure of that information a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would also include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
