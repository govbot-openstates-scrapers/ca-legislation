For purposes of this limitation, \"full cash value\" is defined as the assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975\u201376 tax bill under \"full cash value\" or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing law defines \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" to mean any addition to real property since the last lien date and any alteration of land or of any improvement since the last lien date that constitutes a major rehabilitation thereof or that converts the property to a different use. Existing law, where real property has been damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity, excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" any timely reconstruction of the real property, or portion thereof, where the property after reconstruction is substantially equivalent to the property prior to damage or destruction. \n\nThis bill would authorize an assessor, in the case where state or local government action mandates a suspension or modification of rebuild development standards, and subject to specified law, to align the assessment of \"substantial equivalence\" with the requirements and criteria set forth by the government for reconstruction of property damaged by the 2025 fire disasters in Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia, Sunset, or Woodley, as provided."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation Act: insulation manufacturing license fee."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
