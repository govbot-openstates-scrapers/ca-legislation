{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB858", "title": "Local Government Omnibus Act of 2025.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["LocalGovernmentOmnibusActof2025"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors, by resolution, to authorize the use of a facsimile signature of the chairperson of the board on all papers, documents, or instruments requiring the signature of the chairperson, as provided, if certain requirements are met relating to the personal signature of the chairperson. Under existing law, if those requirements are met, the papers, documents, or instruments bearing the facsimile signature are accorded the same force and effect as though personally signed by the chairperson. \n\nThis bill would remove the requirement for that authorization to occur by resolution of the board. The bill would authorize the board, in addition to authorizing a facsimile signature, to authorize the use of an electronic or digital signature of the chairperson on all papers, documents, or instruments requiring the signature of the chairperson. Under the bill, a document bearing the electronic or digital signature of the chairperson would have the same force and effect as if personally signed by the chairperson.\n\nExisting law also requires ordinances enacted by a county board of supervisors to be signed by the chairperson of the board and attested by the clerk. Existing law requires city ordinances passed by a city council to be signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk. Existing law specifies that, when attesting to a digital signature, a county clerk or a city clerk may presume that the signature is genuine and attributable to the signatory if the digital signature complies with specified requirements.\n\nThis bill would additionally apply the above-described presumption to electronic signatures, as provided.\n\n(2) Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors to authorize the use of photographs, microphotographs, electronic data processing records, optical disks, or any other medium that is a trusted system and that does not permit additions, deletions, or changes to the original document, or photocopies of all records, books, and minutes of the board. Under existing law, if the documents are signed using a digital signature, the reproduced documents are considered authenticated if the reproduced documents are created by a trusted system, as defined in pertinent digital signature regulations.\n\nThis bill would provide that if the documents are signed using an electronic or digital signature, the reproduced documents are considered authenticated if the reproduced documents are created by a trusted system, as defined in pertinent digital signature regulations, or in compliance with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\n\n(3) Existing law authorizes a registrar of voters to be appointed by the board of supervisors in specified counties to discharge all duties vested by law in the county clerk that relate to and are a part of election procedure.\n\nThis bill would include the Counties of Kern and Nevada among those counties in which the board of supervisors is authorized to appoint a registrar of voters.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Counties of Kern and Nevada.\n\n(4) Existing law regulates the investment of public funds by local agencies, as defined. Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a local agency, as specified, that has money in a sinking fund or in its treasury not required for immediate needs to invest the money as it deems wise or expedient in certain securities and financial instruments. In this regard, existing law authorizes investment in prime quality commercial paper issued by entities meeting certain criteria, if the eligible commercial paper has a maximum maturity of 270 days or less.\n\nThis bill would revise the maximum maturity periods for the investments in prime quality commercial paper to 397 days. \n\n(5) Existing law, the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District Act, provides for contracting by the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District. Existing law requires the district, in all work of improvement or repair of any of the works or property of the district and in the furnishing of materials or supplies, when the expenditures exceed $4,000, to do the work by contract let to the lowest responsible bidder, after prescribed notice, as specified.\n\nThis bill would specify that \"furnishing of materials and supplies\" referenced in the above-described provision is for work of improvement or repair of any of the works or property of the district. The bill would also make a nonsubstantive change with respect to the act.\n\nExisting law further authorizes the board of trustees of the district to declare a state of emergency and take prescribed actions. Existing law requires the board of trustees to comply with certain emergency contracting procedures, if, with regard to actions taken during the emergency, notice for bids to let contracts will not be given.\n\nThis bill would delete the authorization for the board of trustees to declare a state of emergency and take prescribed actions and would delete the above-described requirement.\n\n(6) Existing law, the Municipal Utility District Act, governs the formation and governance of municipal utility districts. The act provides that the government of every district is vested in a board of 5 or 7 directors and specifies procedures for filling a vacancy on a board. Those procedures authorize the remaining board members to fill a vacancy by appointment until the next district general election that is scheduled 90 or more days after the effective date of the vacancy, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the person appointed to fill a vacancy to hold office until the person elected at the next district general election that is scheduled 90 or more days after the effective date of the vacancy has been qualified and takes office.\n\n(7) The bill would also correct various cross-references, as provided."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
