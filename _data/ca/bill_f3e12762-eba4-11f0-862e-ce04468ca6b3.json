If a business knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship, existing law requires the business to register with the CPPA as a data broker, except as specified. Existing law requires the CPPA to establish an accessible deletion mechanism that allows a consumer to request that every data broker delete any personal information related to that consumer held by the data broker or associated service provider or contractor. Existing law requires the accessible deletion mechanism to support the ability of a consumer's authorized agents to aid in the deletion request. Existing law requires data brokers to access the accessible deletion mechanism and delete personal information as requested by individuals, and imposes specified deletion procedures. Existing law defines \"personal information\" for these purposes, and exempts from this definition, among other things, publicly available information or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern.\n\nThis bill, on and after January 1, 2028, would require data brokers to delete, and would prohibit data brokers from sharing or selling, \"protected information\" about an elected official, a judge, or an immediate family member of an elected official or judge if they or their authorized agent submits to the accessible deletion mechanism a verified deletion request and a threat identification letter, as specified. The bill would require the CPPA to develop a model threat identification letter and to update the accessible deletion mechanism accordingly, as specified. The bill would define \"protected information\" to include, among other types of information, an individual's residential address and telephone number. The bill would define \"threat identification letter\" to include, among other documents, a police report indicating that the individual has received a threat of intent to cause imminent great bodily harm."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act: personal information of elected and appointed officials."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
