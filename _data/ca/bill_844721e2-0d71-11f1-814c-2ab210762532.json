CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nThis bill would provide that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation to amend the Public Resources Code to increase accessibility and transparency and to enhance environmental review of projects creating disproportionate adverse impacts in environmentally burdened communities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
