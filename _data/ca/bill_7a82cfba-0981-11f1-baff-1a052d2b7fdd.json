Existing law requires an employer who fails to provide an employee a mandated meal or rest or recovery period to pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest or recovery period was not provided.\n\nExisting law provides, until January 1, 2026, an exemption from the rest period requirements for specified employees who hold a safety-sensitive position at a petroleum facility, as defined, to the extent that the employee is required to carry and monitor a communication device and to respond to emergencies or is required to remain on employer premises to monitor the premises and respond to emergencies. Existing law requires another rest period to be authorized in the case of an interrupted rest period, as prescribed, and, if circumstances do not allow for the employee to take a rest period, requires the employer to pay the employee one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of pay for the rest period that was not provided.\n\nThis bill would extend that exemption indefinitely. The bill would specify that the exemption also applies to employees who hold a safety-sensitive position at a refinery that produces fuel through the processing of alternative feedstock."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
