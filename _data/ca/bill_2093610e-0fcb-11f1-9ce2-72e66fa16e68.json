CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nCEQA specifies when an action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul certain acts or decisions of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA is required to commence.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to the latter provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
