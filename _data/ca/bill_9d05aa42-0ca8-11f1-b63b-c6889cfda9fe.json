Existing law authorizes the commission, after a hearing, to make and serve an order directing additions, extensions, repairs, improvements, or other changes to be made to an existing plant, equipment, apparatus, facilities, or other physical property of a public utility, if it makes certain findings. Existing law requires that the commission, as a basis for making any such order relating to the location of structures, give consideration to, and include in its order, findings on community values, recreation and park areas, historical and aesthetic values, and, except as specified, influence on the environment.\n\nThis bill would require that the commission, as a basis for making an order relating to the location of structures, also give consideration to, and include in its order, findings on anticipated maintenance costs.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
