The act provides for the investigation and discipline of members of the State Bar and authorizes the Supreme Court to suspend or disbar an attorney for specified causes, including for a conviction under the laws of another state or territory of the United States that is deemed a felony. Existing law provides that specified evidence that a licensee of the State Bar committed professional misconduct in another jurisdiction is conclusive evidence that the licensee is culpable of professional misconduct.\n\nThis bill would provide that an excluded event shall not be grounds for disciplinary action or require an attorney or applicant to report the excluded event to the State Bar, supply evidence that an attorney is culpable of professional misconduct in this state, or serve as grounds to deny admission to the State Bar to an applicant. The bill would define \"excluded event\" to mean certain actions taken when based on the application of another state's law that interferes with any person's right to receive, provide, recommend, enable, or advocate for sensitive services, as defined, that would be lawful in this state."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Duties of a limited conservator."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
