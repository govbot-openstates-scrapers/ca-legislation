A violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would expand those provisions to prohibit a retailer from selling nitrous oxide in any retail location, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n(2) Existing law categorizes certain drugs and other substances as controlled substances and prohibits various actions related to those substances, including their manufacture, transportation, sale, possession, and ingestion.\n\nThis bill would make the sale or distribution of a product containing 7-hydroxymitragynine, except as it naturally occurs in the plant Mitragyna speciosa, a misdemeanor.\n\n(3) By creating a new crime, and by expanding the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public health: kratom and nitrous oxide."}, {"note": "", "title": "Juries: peremptory challenges."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
