In this regard, if a rule or regulation prohibits either renting or subleasing by a homeowner, existing law prohibits management from renting a mobilehome it owns, except to house onsite employees, avoid a vacancy, or continue a rental agreement executed before January 1, 2022, as specified. Existing law exempts from these provisions mobilehomes and mobilehome sites restricted to affordable housing uses in a park owned by specified nonprofit, government, or other qualified entities, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally exempt from the above-described provisions a mobilehome park that is located in a city or county that is, or has been in the prior 6 months, under a state of emergency caused by a disaster or conditions that resulted in housing units being damaged, destroyed, or rendered uninhabitable, or that is located in an adjacent city or county. In this regard, the bill would allow the mobilehome park to directly rent a mobilehome to a tenant on a limited emergency basis, as specified, not to exceed 36 months from the expiration of the state of emergency. The bill would specify that this exemption would apply for the duration of a tenancy in which the tenant is using the mobilehome as their personal and actual residence.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
