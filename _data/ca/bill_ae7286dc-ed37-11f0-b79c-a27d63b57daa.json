A person who violates a provision of the Radiologic Technology Act or regulation of the department adopted pursuant to that act is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person from holding themselves out as a radiologist assistant unless the person meets certain requirements, including that they have passed the radiologist assistant examination, as specified, and that they maintain current registration with prescribed entities. The bill would require a radiologist assistant to work only under the supervision of a radiologist and would prohibit a radiologist assistant from functioning in that capacity independent of a supervising radiologist. The bill, among other things, would authorize a radiologist assistant to communicate and document initial clinical and imaging observations or procedures only to a radiologist for the radiologist's use. The bill would authorize a supervising radiologist to delegate to a radiologist assistant, as the radiologist determines appropriate to the assistant's competence, those tasks or services that a radiologist usually performs and is qualified to perform. The bill would provide that a violation of its provisions does not constitute a misdemeanor."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
