The bill would define qualified cleanup expenses for this purpose to mean costs directly related to the one-time removal and disposal of unauthorized encampments, illegal dumping, and abandoned property, as provided. The bill would require a taxpayer to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the costs reflected in documentation are directly related to qualified cleanup expenses. The bill would make related findings. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
