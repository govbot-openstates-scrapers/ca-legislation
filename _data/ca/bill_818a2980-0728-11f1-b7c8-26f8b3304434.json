The act prohibits a producer from selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing covered materials in the state unless the producer is approved to participate in the producer responsibility plan of a producer responsibility organization, as prescribed, for the source reduction, collection, processing, and recycling of covered material, except as provided. The act requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to adopt regulations necessary to implement and enforce the act, as specified. The act also requires the department to report to the Legislature, by January 1 of each odd-numbered year, the department's progress in implementing the act, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead require the department to make that report to the Legislature by January 2 of each odd-numbered year."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
