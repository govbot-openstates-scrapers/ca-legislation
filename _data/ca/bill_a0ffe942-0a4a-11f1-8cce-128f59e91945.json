The Medi-Cal program is in part governed by, and funded pursuant to, federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting federal law, enacted on July 4, 2025, sets forth various changes to different health care programs, including certain requirements for Medicaid eligibility with regard to work or community engagement reporting, redeterminations, and cost sharing, among other factors, for certain Medicaid populations pursuant to a specified implementation timeline.\n\nThis bill would create the California Health Access Fund, to be administered by the department. Under the bill, moneys in the fund would include deposits, through any applicable transfers made by the Legislature, equal to the amount of any savings to the state resulting from decreased enrollment in the Medi-Cal program caused by enrollment barriers created by the above-described federal law.\n\nUnder the bill, moneys in the fund would, upon appropriation, be used to ensure that California residents losing health care coverage due to the impacts of the federal law or due to any other divestments from the health care system can continue to receive health care services and that health care providers are reimbursed for these services."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
