Existing law also authorizes the board, in its discretion and after considering the views and interests of the victim, to advance a hearing to an earlier date, when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim's safety does not require additional incarceration. Existing law authorizes an inmate to request that the board exercise its discretion to advance a hearing and provides the procedure for an inmate to make that request. \n\nThis bill would remove the board's authority to advance a parole hearing to an earlier date and would remove the corresponding provisions authorizing an inmate to request an advancement of their hearing date."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
