Existing law specifies that \"community health worker\" include Promotores, Promotores de Salud, Community Health Representatives, navigators, and other nonlicensed health workers with the qualifications developed by the department. \n\nThis bill would also specify for these purposes that a \"community health worker\" includes a peer support specialist and would deem a certified peer support specialist to have satisfied all education and training requirements developed by the department for certification as a community health worker."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
