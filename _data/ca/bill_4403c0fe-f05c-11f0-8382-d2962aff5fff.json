Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the activities of an alarm company operator unless the person holds a valid alarm company operator's license. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a crime. \n\nExisting law defines the term \"alarm system\" for purposes of the act to mean an assembly of equipment and devices arranged to detect a hazard or signal the presence of an off-normal situation, and excludes a fire protection system, as specified.\n\nThis bill would specify that \"alarm system\" for these purposes includes a video system in which an analog or digital video signal travels from the camera to video monitoring stations. To the extent that the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
