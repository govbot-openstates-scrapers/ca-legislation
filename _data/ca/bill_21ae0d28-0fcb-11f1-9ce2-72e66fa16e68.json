Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to update its LCAP before July 1 of each year and requires that annual update to be developed using a template adopted by the state board.\n\nExisting law establishes the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CalPADS) and requires, among other things, the State Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Legislative Analyst's Office, to include data on a quarterly rate of pupil attendance in the system, if federal funds are received for this purpose.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact future legislation to create a task force to evaluate and provide recommendations to the Governor and Legislature related to the necessary components of a single, centralized statewide data reporting system for local educational agencies, on behalf of the pupils served by local educational agencies in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. The recommended statewide data reporting system would be used to submit required reports and data elements, including, but not limited to, those in CalPADS and LCAPs."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
