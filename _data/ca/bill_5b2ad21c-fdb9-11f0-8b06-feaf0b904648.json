Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law limits the copayment, coinsurance, deductible, and other cost sharing that may be imposed for specified health care services.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a large group health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027, from imposing a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or other cost-sharing requirement for in-network health care services, as defined, provided to an enrollee or insured under 21 years of age, except as otherwise specified. The bill would prohibit an individual or entity from billing or seeking reimbursement, as provided, for in-network health care services provided to an enrollee or insured under 21 years of age, except as otherwise specified. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
