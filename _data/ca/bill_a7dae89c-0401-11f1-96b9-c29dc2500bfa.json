{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1558", "title": "Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["UniformEmergencyVolunteerHealthPractitionersAct"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) in the California Health and Human Services Agency to establish planning and implementation guidelines for emergency medical service systems, as specified. The guidelines are required to address, among other things, disaster response, and the authority is required to provide technical assistance to existing agencies, counties, and cities for the purpose of developing the components of emergency medical services systems. The EMSA is required to adopt rules and regulations, approved by the Commission on Emergency Medical Services, in order to carry out its duties.\n\nExisting law ratifies, approves, and sets forth the provisions of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, an interstate agreement that provides for mutual assistance between states responding to emergencies and disasters. Under the compact, a person who holds a professional license, certificate, or other permit issued by a state party to the compact is deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by a state requesting assistance to render aid involving that skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, as specified.\n\nExisting federal law establishes the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP) program to support states and territories in establishing volunteer registration programs for disasters and public health and medical emergencies. Pursuant to the ESAR-VHP program, the EMSA established the Disaster Healthcare Volunteers program to register volunteers in California. Existing federal law also establishes the Medical Reserve Corps to provide for an adequate supply of volunteers in the case of a federal, state, local, or tribal public health emergency, as specified.\n\nThis bill would enact the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act, which would authorize the establishment of additional volunteer registration systems by additional entities. In this regard, the bill would require a registration system to be an ESAR-VHP program or a local unit of the Medical Reserve Corps, as specified, to be designated by the EMSA as a registration system, or to be operated by one of specified types of entities, including, among others, a disaster relief organization, as defined. The bill would require that a registration system be capable of supplying the EMSA with sufficient information concerning whether a volunteer is licensed to provide specified health or veterinary services in another state or territory of the United States and in good standing before that volunteer provides those services in this state while an emergency declaration is in effect, as specified. The bill would establish scope-of-practice standards for a registered volunteer health practitioner. The bill would authorize the EMSA to limit, restrict, or otherwise regulate, among other things, the duration of practice, the geographical areas in which volunteer health practitioners may practice, and any other matters necessary to coordinate the provision of health or veterinary services during the emergency. The bill would authorize the applicable licensing board and the host entity, as defined, to restrict or modify the health or veterinary services that a volunteer health practitioner may provide. The bill would require the EMSA and host entities to coordinate their activities with the Office of Emergency Services, as specified.\n\nThis bill would exempt a registered volunteer health practitioner from the unauthorized practice provisions for a health or veterinary service unless they have reason to know of an applicable limitation, modification, or restriction or that a similarly licensed practitioner in this state would not be permitted to provide that service. The bill would authorize a health care licensing board to impose administrative sanctions upon a health practitioner licensed in this state for conduct outside of this state in response to an out-of-state emergency, and to impose administrative sanctions upon a practitioner not licensed in this state for conduct in this state in response to an in-state emergency, if certain conditions are met. The bill would also provide that volunteer health practitioners providing services in California shall be considered agents or employees of the state for the purpose of workers' compensation coverage while performing services in this state or traveling to or from this state for that purpose. The bill would authorize the authority to promulgate rules, after approval by the Commission on Emergency Medical Services, in order to implement the provisions of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
