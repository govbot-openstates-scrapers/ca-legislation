Existing law includes a person who operates or uses an unmanned aerial vehicle, remote piloted aircraft, or drone that is at the scene of an emergency, regardless of the person's location.\n\nThis bill would make it a felony to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle, remote piloted aircraft, or drone, in violation of the provision mentioned above, during a fire-related emergency. The bill would make this crime punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for 16 months or for 2 or 3 years and a fine not to exceed $10,000. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
