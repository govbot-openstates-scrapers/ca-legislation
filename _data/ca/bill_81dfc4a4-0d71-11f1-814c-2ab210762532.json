Existing law requires a city or county to update its general plan elements subject to certain criteria and timelines.\n\nThis bill would require a city or county, upon the next update of 2 or more of the elements included in the general plan on or after January 1, 2028, to review and update the land use, circulation, housing, safety, and environmental justice elements, and any other element, where appropriate, to address the childcare needs of the jurisdiction. The bill would require the elements to be reviewed and updated to reflect the goal of ensuring every family has access to quality, convenient, safe, and affordable childcare, as specified.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
