The bill would define qualified payments to mean either amounts received from a pension plan the taxpayer is the beneficiary of based on services performed as a peace officer, as defined, or amounts received as the beneficiary of an annuity plan set up for the surviving spouse or dependent of a person that lost their life in services as a peace officer, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to provide any data requested by the Legislative Analyst's Office to write the report, as provided, and would make taxpayer information received by the Legislative Analyst's Office subject to specified law limiting the collection and use of that information, the violation of which is a crime. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
