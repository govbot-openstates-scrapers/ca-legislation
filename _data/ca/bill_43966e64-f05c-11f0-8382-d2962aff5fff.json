Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides that a health care service plan or a health insurer that authorizes a specific type of treatment by a health care provider shall not rescind or modify this authorization after the provider renders the health care service in good faith and pursuant to the authorization.\n\nThis bill would require a prior authorization for a health care service by a health care service plan or a health insurer to remain valid for a period of at least one year from the date of approval, or throughout the course of prescribed treatment, if less than one year. Because a violation of the bill by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
