{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB495", "title": "Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["FamilyPreparednessPlanActof2025"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Under existing law, a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older and signs a caregiver's authorization affidavit under penalty of perjury for a minor who lives in their home is authorized to enroll the minor in school and consent to school-related medical care on behalf of the minor. Under existing law, a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older, signs the caregiver's authorization affidavit under penalty of perjury, and who is a certain type of relative of the minor who lives in their home, has the same rights to authorize medical care and dental care for the minor that are given to guardians, as specified. Under existing law, a person who acts in good faith reliance on a completed caregiver's authorization affidavit to provide medical or dental care, without actual knowledge of facts contrary to those stated on the affidavit, is not subject to criminal or civil liability or professional disciplinary action for that reliance, but is not relieved from liability for violations of other provisions of law.\n\nThis bill, the Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025, would revise the definition of relative to expand the type of relative who is authorized to execute a caregiver's authorization affidavit and grant them the same rights to authorize school-related medical care, as defined, for the minor that are given to guardians, as specified. By expanding who is authorized to sign a caregiver's authorization affidavit for these purposes under penalty of perjury, this bill would expand the crime of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would amend the statutory form for a caregiver's authorization affidavit.\n\n(2) Existing law generally provides for the establishment and administration of guardianships. Existing law authorizes a court to appoint joint guardians of a person, an estate, or a person and an estate. Existing law requires a nomination of a guardian to become effective when made, and remain effective, unless stated otherwise in writing, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a court, in its discretion, to appoint a custodial parent and a person nominated by the custodial parent as joint guardians of the person of the minor, if the custodial parent will be temporarily unavailable due to specified circumstances, including, among other things, an immigration-related administrative action, as specified. The bill would make all records, petitions, orders, and documents related to these proceedings confidential, as specified.\n\nThe bill would provide that absence is a basis for a delayed effectiveness of a guardianship and that such circumstances would not be a basis for subsequent legal incapacity for the nomination.\n\n(3) Existing law prohibits, except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally supported educational program, school officials and employees of a local educational agency, as defined, from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of pupils or their family members. Existing law requires the governing board or body of a local educational agency to perform specified actions relating to pupils and immigration status, including, among others, providing information to parents and guardians, as appropriate, regarding their child's right to a free public education, regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs. Existing law requires the Attorney General, by April 1, 2018, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, to publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement at public schools, to the fullest extent possible consistent with federal and state law, as specified. Existing law requires all local educational agencies to adopt the model policies developed by the Attorney General, or equivalent policies, by July 1, 2018.\n\nThis bill would revise the information disclosure requirements to require the governing board or body of a local educational agency to provide information related to specified guidance on immigration enforcement issued by the Attorney General and would require that information to be revised as necessary to be consistent with any revisions or updates to the Attorney General's guidance. This bill would also require local educational agencies to revise their model policies as necessary to be consistent with any revisions or updates to the model policies developed by the Attorney General, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child daycare facilities, including daycare centers and daycare homes, by the State Department of Social Services. The act exempts certain types of facilities from licensure under its provisions, including California state preschool programs that meet certain requirements, including, among other things, that the programs are operated by local educational agencies in a school building.\n\nSimilar to the provisions related to local educational agencies described above, this bill would prohibit licensed child daycare facilities, as defined, employees of licensed child daycare facilities, and license-exempt California state preschool program facilities from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of children or their family members, except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally supported educational program. The bill would require the licensee or administrator of a licensed child day care facility, as applicable, to report to the department and the Attorney General any requests for information or access to the facility by an officer or employee of a law enforcement agency. The bill would authorize license-exempt California state preschool program facilities to make that report to the State Department of Education and the Attorney General. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to provide any information on California state preschool programs collected pursuant to those provisions to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The bill would require a licensed child daycare facility and a license-exempt California state preschool program facility to first exhaust any parental instruction relating to the child's care found in the child's emergency contact information if an employee of the facility is aware that a child's parent or authorized representative is not available to care for the child. The bill would require licensees or administrators of those facilities to request that parents or authorized representatives update their emergency contact information. The bill would require the Attorney General, by April 1, 2026, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, to publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement at child daycare facilities and license-exempt California state preschool program facilities similar to the model policies developed for local educational agencies described above. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to inform licensed daycare facilities, and the State Department of Education to inform license-exempt California state preschool program facilities, of the model policies. The bill would require all California state preschool programs to adopt the model policies developed by the Attorney General, or equivalent policies, as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 1, 2026. The bill would require California state preschool programs to update these policies to conform with any revisions or updates to the model policies developed by the Attorney General. The bill would require a licensed child daycare facility and license-exempt California state preschool program facilities to provide the parent or authorized representative with information about how to access those model policies. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to inform licensed child day care facilities, and the State Department of Education to inform license-exempt California state preschool program facilities, of any revisions or updates to the model policies and require any information, policies, or guidance provided by facilities to parents or authorized representatives to be updated to include any revisions or updates to the model policies issued by the Attorney General. The bill would authorize the State Department of Social Services to administer these provisions by interim licensing standards until regulations are adopted.\n\n(5) This bill would provide that its provisions are severable. \n\n(6) Existing constitutional provisions require a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies to be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 234.7 of the Education Code proposed by AB 49, AB 419, or both, to be operative only if this bill and AB 49, AB 419, or both, are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public social services: children."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
