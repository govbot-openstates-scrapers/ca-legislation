Existing law requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to notify all persons covered by the medical release of information within 24 hours of a person incarcerated in a state prison being hospitalized for a serious or critical medical condition, as defined. Existing law requires the department to notify all persons covered by the medical release of information and next of kin within 24 hours of the death of a person incarcerated in state prison.\n\nExisting law provides that a county jail is kept by the sheriff of the county in which the jail is situated and is to be used for specified purposes, including for the confinement of persons sentenced to imprisonment in a county jail upon a criminal conviction.\n\nThis bill, Wakiesha's Law, would require the county or city jail to notify all people covered by the medical release of information and next of kin forms within 24 hours of the death of a person incarcerated in the county or city jail. By imposing new duties on county and city jails, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "County jails: incarcerated person contacts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
