CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. \n\nExisting law requires a person who owns, leases, controls, operates, or maintains specified structures within certain areas to maintain a defensible space around the structures meeting certain requirements.\n\nThis bill would exempt from CEQA projects undertaken or approved by a public agency for purposes of maintaining defensible space to comply with the above requirements.\n\nBecause a lead agency would be required to determine the applicability of the exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
