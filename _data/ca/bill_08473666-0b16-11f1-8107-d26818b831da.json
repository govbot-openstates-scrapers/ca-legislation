Existing law requires the governing board or body of a school district, county office of education, or charter school serving pupils in kindergarten or grades 1 or 2 to adopt, on or before June 30, 2025, one or more screening instruments from the approved list to assess pupils for risk of reading difficulties, as specified, and commencing no later than the 2025\u201326 school year, requires those local educational agencies to assess each pupil in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 for risk of reading difficulties using the screening instrument or instruments adopted by the governing board or body of the local educational agency, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the state board, on or before April 30, 2027, to appoint an independent panel of experts for the purpose of creating an approved list of evidence-based, culturally, linguistically, and developmentally appropriate screening instruments for pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 to assess pupils for math difficulties. The bill would require that panel, on or before January 31, 2028, and at a regularly scheduled public meeting, to vote to approve a list of screening instruments pursuant to the review process and evaluation criteria that the state board would be required to establish. The bill would require the governing board or body of a local educational agency serving pupils in kindergarten or grades 1 or 2 to adopt, on or before June 30, 2028, one or more screening instruments from the approved list to identify pupils experiencing math difficulties, as specified, and commencing no later than the 2028\u201329 school year, would require those local educational agencies to assess each pupil in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 for math difficulties using the screening instrument or instruments adopted by the governing board or body of the local educational agency unless the pupil's parent or guardian opts out of the screening in writing, as provided. The bill would require those local educational agencies, on or before July 15, 2029, and on or before July 15 of each year thereafter, to report to the State Department of Education the number and percentage of pupils in each grade who have been identified as experiencing math difficulties through screening, as provided. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
