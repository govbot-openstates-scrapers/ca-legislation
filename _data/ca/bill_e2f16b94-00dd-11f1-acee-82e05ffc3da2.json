Existing law defines \"geothermal resources\" for purposes of the supervisor's authority. Under existing law, an owner or operator or employee of the owner or operator who refuses to permit the supervisor to the supervisor's agent to inspect a geothermal resources well or who violation regulations related to geothermal resources under the jurisdiction of the supervisor is guilty of a crime.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of \"geothermal resources\" to include oil or gas reservoirs that are used principally for thermal energy storage or geothermal energy generation. Because the bill would expand the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
