Existing law requires, at the next regularly scheduled revision of the curriculum framework in English Language Arts and English Language Development, the commission to consider including content designed to provide teachers with resources to meet the unique academic and English language development needs of newcomer pupils at all grade levels. Existing law also requires the commission to ensure that the instructional materials for pupils in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 8, inclusive, that it recommends to the State Board of Education for adoption include resources to help teachers meet the needs of newcomer pupils.\n\nThis bill would instead require, at the next adoption or followup adoption of instructional materials for use in kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive, in English Language Arts and English Language Development, the commission to consider including resources to help teachers meet the unique academic and English language development needs of newcomer pupils.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt a state master plan for services to migrant children, as provided. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in implementing the state master plan for services to migrant children, to establish the service regional system as the primary method for the delivery of services to migrant children. Existing law requires the Superintendent to review and approve plans for the establishment of service regions and to incorporate specified criteria in the approval of regional plans, as provided.\n\nExisting law defines \"migrant region,\" for purposes of this law pertaining to services for migrant children, as an operating agency comprised of a county or a combination of counties, or a public or private nonprofit agency not controlled in whole or part by a school district, or a combination of counties and agencies, meeting specified criteria.\n\nThis bill would revise the definition of \"migrant region\" to instead mean an operating agency meeting the specified criteria comprised of a county office of education or a combination of county offices of education, a combination of school districts within a county, a public or private nonprofit agency not controlled in whole or part by a school district, or a combination of county offices of education and public or private nonprofit agencies.\n\n(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pupil instruction: migrant education: migrant regions."}, {"note": "", "title": "Pupil instruction: dual enrollment programs: regional occupational centers or programs: migrant education: migrant regions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
