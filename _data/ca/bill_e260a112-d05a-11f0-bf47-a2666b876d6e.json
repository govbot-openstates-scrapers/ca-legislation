Existing law prohibits a landlord or its agent from charging a tenant a fee for serving, posting, or otherwise delivering a notice of termination of a hiring of residential property, as specified. Existing law also prohibits a landlord or its agent from charging a tenant any fee for payment by check for rent or security deposit, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require on or after April 1, 2026, a landlord or landlord's agent who advertises, displays, or offers residential property for rent to include in any advertisement, display, or offer the price, including all required fees or charges, and a description of all available optional housing services, as defined, including the associated fees for each optional housing service.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a landlord or landlord's agent from using a ratio utility billing system to allocate, demand, or collect fees or charges from a tenant, except for fees or charges for water or sewer service, as provided. The bill would prohibit the landlord from charging any fee or charge other than required fees and charges, as defined, and fees or charges for optional housing services.\n\nThis bill would also require that any payment received from, or on behalf of, a tenant be applied to rent, rental debt, and any outstanding fees in a specified order, and would prohibit late fees from being charged to a tenant whose only delinquency is attributable to nonpayment or late payment of a late fee.
