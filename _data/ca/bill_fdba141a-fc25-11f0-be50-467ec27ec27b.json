Existing law requires the board of an association of a condominium project to cause a visual inspection to be conducted, at least every 9 years, of the exterior elevated elements for which the association has maintenance or repair responsibility. Existing law requires an inspector to perform the visual inspection described above, as specified, and to issue a written report containing certain information, including recommendations for any necessary repair or replacement of the load-bearing components and associated waterproofing system, as those terms are defined. Existing law limits the above-described provisions related to exterior elevated element inspections to buildings containing 3 or more multifamily dwelling units. Existing law requires the owner of a separate interest, as defined, to provide specified documents to a prospective purchaser, as provided, and an association, as defined, to provide to the owner of a separate interest, upon request, those specified documents. Existing law requires an association to distinguish and bill separately any fee charged for providing those specified documents to a separate interest owner and provides a form for billing disclosures, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, in addition, require the above-described inspector's report to contain certain information, including the total number of units in the condominium project, as prescribed, and a certification that the inspector has conducted a visual inspection and evaluated a statistically significant sample, as defined, of the exterior elevated elements within the condominium project. The bill would, instead, apply the above-described provisions related to exterior elevated element inspections to buildings containing 3 or more attached multifamily dwelling units. The bill would include in the list of documents that a separate interest owner is required to provide to a prospective purchaser a copy of the report issued pursuant to the most recent inspection of any exterior elevated elements, as provided, and would modify the above-described form to reflect this requirement.\n\n Existing law requires an association to make association records available for inspection and copying by a member of the association or the member's designated representative, as specified. Existing law defines the term association records for this purpose to include, among other things, any financial document or statement required to be provided pursuant to certain provisions governing the prospective purchase of a separate interest, as described above. Existing law provides specified time periods for member inspection of certain association records, including those described above, and generally requires any association records from the current fiscal year and the prior 2 fiscal years to be available for inspection, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would include in the definition of association records the above-described inspector's reports and would require those reports to be available for member inspection for 2 inspection cycles, as provided."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: general plan: zoning ordinance."}, {"note": "", "title": "Common interest developments: disclosures to prospective purchasers: exterior elevated elements inspection."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
