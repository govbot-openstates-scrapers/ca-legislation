Among other things, that act also authorizes a mutual water company to enter into a joint powers agreement with any public agency for the purposes of risk pooling, as specified. Existing law, the Government Claims Act, among other things, authorizes public entities, mutual water companies, public agencies, water corporations, and mutual water companies to provide insurance under that act by a joint powers agreement, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize a nonprofit housing developer to enter into a joint powers agreement with any public agency for the purpose of risk pooling, and would expand the list of entities authorized to provide insurance by a joint powers agreement to include nonprofit housing developers. The bill would require that, if a nonprofit housing developer enters into a joint powers agreement with one or more public agencies, that the agreement ensure that no participating public agency becomes responsible for the underlying debts or liabilities of the joint powers agreement and that any participating public agency be indemnified against those debts and liabilities. The bill would require a joint powers agreement established pursuant to this authorization to solely utilize any revenues it generates to provide technical support, continuing education, safety engineering, and operational and managerial advisory assistance to its members for the purpose of reducing risk liabilities and furthering the technical managerial and financial capacity of those members.\n\nExisting law also authorizes 2 or more local public entities having the same governing board, a mutual water company and a public agency, or a water corporation, a mutual water company, and one or more public agencies, as specified, to be coinsured under a master policy and the total premium prorated among them.\n\nThis bill would recast the provisions described above, provide that the affected entities are those authorized pursuant to specified provisions, and include among those entities nonprofit housing developers."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
