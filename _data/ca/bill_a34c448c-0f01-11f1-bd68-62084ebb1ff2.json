Existing law requires suspension to be imposed only when other means of correction, including, among other things, a conference between school personnel, the pupil's parent or guardian, and the pupil, fail to bring about proper conduct.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact future legislation that would, among other things, require that a pupil and the parent or guardian of a pupil who engages in repeated acts of cyberbullying or is suspended for cyberbullying participate in a program of rehabilitative cyberbullying education, counseling, or training."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
