Existing law includes in that definition speech-language pathology services and certain other services if the service is considered special education rather than a designated instruction and service or related service under state standards.\n\nThis bill would prohibit those provisions from being construed to prohibit an individualized education program from including specialized deaf and hard-of-hearing related services as the only services."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Special education."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
