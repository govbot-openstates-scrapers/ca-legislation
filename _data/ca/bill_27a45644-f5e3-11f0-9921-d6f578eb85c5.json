Existing law prohibits a licensee from allowing an employee to perform the functions of a security guard without confirming that the person holds a current and valid security guard registration. Existing law requires an applicant for a security guard registration to complete a course in the exercise of the power to arrest and the appropriate use of force as a condition for the issuance of the registration, as provided. Existing law authorizes a licensee, among others, to administer, test, and certify those trainings. Existing law requires the application to be verified and include specified information, including a statement that the applicant has completed the training course in the exercise of the power to arrest and the appropriate use of force. \n\nThis bill would require the training to be administered and certified by a single course provider, as provided, and to be completed within 6 months preceding the date the application is submitted to the bureau. The bill would also authorize a licensee to administer, test, and certify those trainings, provided that the licensee is required to provide the training only to their applicants for employment and direct employees. The bill would also require the above-described statement on completion of the training course to include that it was completed within 6 months preceding the date the application is submitted to the bureau. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
