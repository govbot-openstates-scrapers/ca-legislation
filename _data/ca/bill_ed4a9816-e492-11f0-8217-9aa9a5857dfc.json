Existing law requires every taxpayer subject to tax under the law to file a return with the Franchise Tax Board, and requires specified identifying numbers to be included on state tax returns, statements, and other documents, including a federal social security number (SSN) or individual tax identification number (ITIN) , unless otherwise provided.\n\nExisting law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before January 1, 2026, prohibits the Franchise Tax Board from requiring a nonresident alien, as defined, to provide an SSN or ITIN when filing a state tax return, statement, or other document if the nonresident alien is not eligible for or has not been issued an SSN or ITIN. Existing law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before January 1, 2026, also requires the Franchise Tax Board to provide for the filing of a group return for electing nonresident aliens, as specified, and excludes from gross income any payments made by an agent on behalf of a nonresident in a group filing.\n\nThis bill would extend indefinitely the prohibition on the Franchise Tax Board from requiring a nonresident alien to provide an SSN or ITIN, as described above, the requirement that the Franchise Tax Board provide for the filing of a group return for electing nonresident aliens, as specified, and the exclusion from gross income for any payments made by an agent on behalf of a nonresident in a group filing. The bill would make additional conforming changes related to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
