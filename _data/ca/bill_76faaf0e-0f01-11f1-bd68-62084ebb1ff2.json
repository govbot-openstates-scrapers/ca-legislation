Existing law defines \"surplus land\" for these purposes to mean land owned in fee simple by any local agency for which the local agency's governing body takes formal action in a regular public meeting declaring that the land is surplus and is not necessary for the agency's use. Existing law provides that an agency is not required to follow certain requirements for the disposal of surplus land for \"exempt surplus land,\" as defined. Existing law, the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994, authorizes local governmental entities to establish a property and business improvement district to levy assessments on properties and businesses within the district for the purpose of financing certain improvements and promoting activities that benefit property in the district. Existing law requires the California Environmental Protection Agency to identify disadvantaged communities for investment opportunities from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and for other purposes.\n\nThis bill would define \"exempt surplus land\" to include surplus land that is owned by a local agency and is located within a property and business improvement district designated pursuant to the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994 and a disadvantaged community identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the above-referenced provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
