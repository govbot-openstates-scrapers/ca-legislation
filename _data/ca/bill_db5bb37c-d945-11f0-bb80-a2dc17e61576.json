The bill would define \"automated decision system\" to mean a computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is designed or used to assist or replace human discretionary decisionmaking and materially impacts natural persons.\n\nThis bill would require a developer of a covered ADS, as defined, to take certain actions, including conduct impact assessments of the covered ADS and provide deployers to whom the developer transfers the covered ADS with certain information, including a high-level summary of the results of those impact assessments.\n\nThis bill would, beginning January 1, 2027, require a deployer of a covered ADS to take certain actions, including provide certain disclosures to a subject of a consequential decision made or facilitated by the covered ADS and provide the subject with an opportunity to appeal the outcome of the consequential decision, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require a developer, deployer, or auditor to, within 30 days of receiving a request from the Attorney General, provide an unredacted copy of the impact assessment prepared pursuant to the bill to the Attorney General and would exempt those records from the California Public Records Act.\n\nThis bill would authorize certain public entities, including the Attorney General, to bring a specified civil action for noncompliance.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
