Installation of an IID is discretionary for a first offender, as specified. Existing law also requires persons convicted of driving under the influence of a drug to install an IID. Existing law specifies periods for which a person convicted of one or more prior driving-under-the-influence violations is required to install an IID, as specified. A violation of the Vehicle Code is a crime punishable as an infraction, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish, until January 1, 2033, a pilot program in the Counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno, Sacramento, and Kern that would impose a similar requirement for persons convicted of specified driving offenses relating to excessive speed, reckless driving, and exhibitions of speed to install for a period of time, as ordered by the court, a certified active intelligent speed assist device (ISA) on any vehicle the person operates. The bill would similarly make the installation of an ISA discretionary for a first offender, as specified. The bill would establish periods for which a person convicted of one or more prior specified driving offenses is required to install an ISA, as specified. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to create a verification installation form to be submitted by persons subject to these provisions. The bill would impose a fee schedule to be adopted by certified ISA manufacturers and their agents for the ISA and other related costs. By creating new crimes related to the installation and maintenance of an ISA, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require, by July 1, 2030, the department to report data to the Transportation Agency regarding the implementation and efficacy of the pilot program, as specified, and require the Transportation Agency to report to the Legislature on the outcomes of the pilot program by July 1, 2031.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno, Sacramento, and Kern.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
