{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB280", "title": "Elections.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Elections"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law authorizes a candidate for elective office to submit a petition containing a specified number of signatures in lieu of all or part of the fee for filing nomination papers. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to make forms for securing signatures available to each candidate commencing 60 days before the first day for circulating nomination papers, except as specified, and requires candidates to file in-lieu-filing-fee petitions at least 30 days before the close of the nomination period.\n\nThis bill, for the June 2, 2026, statewide direct primary election, would require the Secretary of State to make those forms available beginning December 19, 2025. This bill would require the Secretary of State to prepare a calendar of key election dates and deadlines and requirements for the nomination of candidates by the date that the in-lieu-filing-fee petition forms are made available.\n\n(2) Existing law requires each county elections official to provide the Secretary of State with specified information regarding the number of voters and their party preferences in the county and each supervisorial, Congressional, Senate, Assembly, and Board of Equalization district in the county on the 135th day before each direct primary election, with respect to all voters who are registered voters on the 154th day before the primary election. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to compile a statewide list of this information within 30 days after receiving it from each county elections official.\n\nThis bill would require the Secretary of State to determine, by December 19, 2025, whether it is feasible to include in the statewide list described above the number of voters by party preference in each congressional district with respect to all voters who are registered voters on the 154th day before the June 2, 2026, statewide direct primary election. If the Secretary of State determines it is not feasible, the bill would not require that information to be included in the information provided by the counties and the compiled statewide list. The bill would require the Secretary of State to prepare a supplemental statewide list showing that information on a date specified by the Secretary of State, but not later than the 88th day before the June 2, 2026, statewide direct primary election.\n\n(3) Existing law authorizes a candidate for elective office to designate that certain specified words appear below the candidate's name on the ballot, including, among others, the word \"incumbent.\"\n\nThis bill, for the June 2, 2026, statewide direct primary election, would prohibit a candidate for the office of Representative in Congress from choosing the word \"incumbent\" as a designation to appear on the ballot. The bill would make conforming changes relating to the deadline for a person to file nomination documents for an office if a current holder of the office does not file nomination documents. These provisions would become operative only if ACA 8 of the 2025\u201326 Regular Session is approved by the voters and another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after August 1, 2025.\n\n(4) The bill would repeal the provisions described in paragraphs (1) to (3) above on January 1, 2027.\n\n(5) Existing law requires a constitutional amendment submitted to the people by the Legislature to appear on the ballot of the first statewide election occurring at least 131 days after the adoption of the proposal.\n\nThis bill would call a special election to be held throughout the state on November 4, 2025, and, notwithstanding the 131-day requirement, would require the submission of ACA 8 of the 2025\u201326 Regular Session to the voters at that special election. The bill would authorize a local election called on or before August 8, 2025, and scheduled to be held on November 4, 2025, to be consolidated with the statewide special election. The bill would require that the impartial analysis prepared by the Legislative Analyst for the state voter information guide for the special election include specified content regarding 2021 and 2025 congressional district maps.\n\nThe bill would specify the procedures under which the special election would be conducted. Counties that conduct all-mailed ballot elections using vote centers would be required to maintain at least one vote center for every 30,000 registered voters from November 1, 2025, to November 4, 2025, and at least one vote center for every 60,000 registered voters from October 25, 2025, through October 31, 2025. Other counties would be authorized to consolidate polling places at a maximum ratio of one for every 10,000 registered voters.\n\nThe bill would appropriate an amount from the General Fund to the Controller for the actual and reasonably necessary costs for counties to conduct the special election, as determined by the Director of Finance. The bill would also appropriate an amount from the General Fund to the Secretary of State for the actual and reasonably necessary costs for the Secretary of State to administer the special election, as determined by the Director of Finance.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Political Reform Act of 1974: prohibition on contributions in state and local government office buildings."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
