CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nThis bill would exempt a fuel modification project to maintain defensible space of 500 feet from each side and from the front and rear of a building or structure and a fuel reduction project to prevent and contain the spread of wildfires from the requirements of CEQA. The bill would also exempt an electrical grid resilience or hardening project from the requirements of CEQA. Because a lead agency would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for these exemptions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) The California Coastal Act of 1976, among other things, requires anyone wishing to perform or undertake any development in the coastal zone, in addition to obtaining any other permit required by law from any local government or from any state, regional, or local agency, to obtain a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission or a local government, as provided. Existing law exempts certain emergency work and emergency projects from these requirements, as specified.\n\nThis bill would exempt a fuel modification project to maintain defensible space of 500 feet from each side and from the front and rear of a building or structure and a fuel reduction project to prevent and contain the spread of wildfires from these requirements.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Fuel modification and reduction projects: California Environmental Quality Act: coastal development permits: exemptions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
