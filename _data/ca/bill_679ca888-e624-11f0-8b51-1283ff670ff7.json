Most recently, existing law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, allows a motion picture credit (motion picture credit 4.0) to be allocated by the California Film Commission on or after July 1, 2025, and before July 1, 2030, in an amount equal to 20% or 25% of qualified expenditures for the production of a qualified motion picture in this state. Existing law establishes the California Film Commission to administer the motion picture credits, to provide services necessary to increase filming in the state, and to implement specified programs related to the motion picture industry, including a program to promote media production in the state.\n\nThis bill, upon appropriation by the Legislature, would require the California Film Commission to integrate additional data collection requirements, as specified, into the existing motion picture tax credit framework. The bill would require the commission, in consultation with industry stakeholders, payroll companies, and subject matter experts, to adopt definitions, reporting templates, and metrics for the additional data collection, and to develop protocols to reduce nonresponse rates. The bill would require the commission to address noncompliance with the data collection requirements through existing enforcement conditions and procedures of the motion picture tax credits, as provided. The bill would additionally require the commission to publish an annual compliance report summarizing the collected data, trends in diversity and economic impact, and recommendations for program improvements."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Corporation Tax Law: credit: motion picture."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
