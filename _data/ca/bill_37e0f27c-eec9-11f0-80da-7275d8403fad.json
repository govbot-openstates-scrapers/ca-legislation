Under the act, when a person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to self or others, or gravely disabled, the person may, upon probable cause, be taken into custody by specified individuals, including, among others, by a peace officer, a designated member of a mobile crisis team, or a professional person designated by the county, and placed in a facility designated by the county and approved by the State Department of Health Care Services for up to 72 hours for evaluation and treatment. Existing law authorizes county behavioral health director to develop procedures for the county's designation and training of professionals who will be designated to perform the above-described provisions. Existing law authorizes the procedures to include, among others, the license types, practice disciplines, and clinical experience of the professionals eligible to be designated by the county. Existing law exempts specified individuals, including a peace officer responsible for the detainment of a person under these provisions from criminal and civil liability for an action by a person who is released at or before the end of the period for which they were detained.\n\nThis bill would require a county behavioral health director to include an emergency physician, as defined, as one of the practice disciplines eligible to be designated by the county when developing and implementing procedures for the designation and training of those professionals. The bill would also exempt an emergency physician who is responsible for the detainment of a person under those provisions from criminal and civil liability, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
