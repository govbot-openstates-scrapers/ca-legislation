The bill would also require law enforcement, prior to making an arrest of the individual pursuant to these provisions, to document their attempts to offer the individual services. By creating a new crime, and by imposing new duties on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Crimes: false imprisonment and human trafficking."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
