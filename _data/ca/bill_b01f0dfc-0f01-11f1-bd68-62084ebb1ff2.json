Existing law requires the Board of Parole Hearings, when considering the release of qualifying inmates, to give special consideration to whether certain criteria have reduced the elderly inmate's risk for future violence. Existing law excludes various persons from these provisions, including persons sentenced pursuant to existing sentencing provisions commonly known as the three strikes law. Under an existing court order, although statutorily excluded, an individual may be eligible for parole under the Elderly Parole Program when they are 60 years of age or older and have been continuously incarcerated for at least 25 years.\n\nThis bill would instead specify that persons required to register as sexual offenders, habitual sexual offenders, and persons convicted of various sexual offenses, including rape or sodomy, are not suitable for parole under the Elderly Parole Program until the person is 60 years of age or older and has served a minimum of 25 years of continuous incarceration on their current sentence."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
