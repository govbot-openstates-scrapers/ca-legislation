{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1362", "title": "Foreign labor contractor registration: agricultural workers.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Foreignlaborcontractorregistration", "agriculturalworkers"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law establishes the Department of Industrial Relations within the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and sets forth the functions of the department, which include, among others, fostering, promoting, and developing the welfare of the wage earners of California and improving their working conditions. Existing law establishes within the department the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, headed by the Labor Commissioner, for the purposes of enforcing labor laws. \n\nExisting law requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce and administer a program to register and supervise foreign labor contractors who perform foreign labor contracting activities to recruit or solicit foreign workers. Existing law defines foreign workers for purposes of these provisions to mean any person seeking employment who is not a United States citizen or permanent resident but who is authorized by the federal government to work in the United States, including a person who engages in temporary nonagricultural labor, as specified. Existing law requires foreign labor contractors to register under the program, as prescribed. Existing law requires an applicant for registration as a foreign labor contractor to execute a written application in a form prescribed by the commissioner, as specified, that includes, among other things, the names and addresses of all persons financially interested in the proposed operation as a foreign labor contractor, as provided. Existing law imposes specific requirements on foreign labor contractors relating to recruitment or solicitation for employment and relating to work contracts. Existing law authorizes the commissioner to adopt regulations or policies and procedures to implement these provisions. Existing law authorizes the commissioner, or a person aggrieved by a violation of these provisions, to bring certain actions against the violator, including an action for injunctive relief, as provided. A violation of these provisions is a crime.\n\n Existing law makes these provisions applicable only to nonagricultural workers, and exempts persons licensed as farm labor contractors, specified persons exempt from farm labor contractor licensing requirements, and employers of agricultural workers.\n\nThis bill would, beginning July 1, 2027, expand the above-described provisions to agricultural workers under the federal H-2A visa program. The bill would make related conforming changes and findings and declarations. The bill would additionally require, beginning July 1, 2027, the above-described application to contain a listing of each federal visa program under which the person will be performing foreign labor contracting activities. The bill would authorize the commissioner to enforce the above-described foreign labor contractor registration provisions through specified procedures, including the issuance of a citation or filing of a civil action against a person who violates those provisions.\n\n(2) Existing law requires farm labor contractors to be licensed by the commissioner and to comply with specified employment laws applicable to farm labor contractors. Existing law prohibits the commissioner from issuing to any person, or renewing, a license to act as a farm labor contractor unless certain conditions are satisfied, including a requirement that the person has executed a written application in a form prescribed by the commissioner as a foreign labor contractor, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require, beginning July 1, 2027, a person who is licensed or acting as a farm labor contractor and who performs foreign labor contracting activities to register with the commissioner as a foreign labor contractor, as prescribed. The bill would authorize the commissioner to eliminate duplicative application information requirements for information previously obtained from the farm labor contractor's license application, as specified. By expanding the application of the foreign labor contractor registration provisions, the bill would expand an existing crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Industrial Relations to submit to the Legislature, by January 1, 2028, a study on how to extend foreign labor contractor registration requirements to certain foreign labor contractors, as specified.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
