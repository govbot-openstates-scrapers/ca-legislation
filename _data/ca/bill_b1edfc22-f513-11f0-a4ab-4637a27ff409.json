The act authorizes any local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin to decide to become a groundwater sustainability agency for that basin. The act deems certain agencies created by statute to manage groundwater the exclusive local agencies within their respective statutory boundaries with powers to comply with the act and authorizes these agencies to opt out of being the exclusive groundwater management agency.\n\nThis bill would create the Tule East Groundwater Sustainability Agency and would establish the agency's initial boundaries. The bill would authorize the boundaries of the agency to be adjusted, as specified. The bill would require the agency to elect to be a groundwater sustainability agency under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act for that portion of the Tule Subbasin that lies within the boundaries of the agency and would require the agency to develop and implement a groundwater sustainability plan to achieve sustainable groundwater management within the territory of the agency. The bill would generally specify the powers and purposes of the agency. The bill would prescribe the composition of the 5-member board of directors of the agency and would require members and alternates to be chosen, as specified. By imposing duties on the agency and the County of Tulare, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would deem the Tule East Groundwater Sustainability Agency the exclusive local agency with powers to comply with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Tule Subbasin.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Serious felonies: furnishing fentanyl to a minor."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
