Existing law requires the commissioner to convene a working group to identify, assess, and recommend risk transfer market mechanisms that promote investment in natural infrastructure to reduce the risks of climate change related to catastrophic events, create incentives for investment in natural infrastructure to reduce risks to communities, and provide mitigation incentives for private investment in natural lands to lessen exposure and reduce climate risks to public safety, property, utilities, and infrastructure.\n\nThis bill would require the department to establish and administer the Climate and Sustainability Insurance and Risk Reduction Grant Program, to be funded upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of achieving specified goals, including developing proofs of concept that expand insurance options and testing community-purchased insurance to reduce overall insurance costs, as specified. The bill would require the department to report to the Senate Committee on Insurance and the Assembly Committee on Insurance on program results on or before January 1, 2029, and on or before January 1 every 3 years thereafter. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2035."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Insurance: reinsurance."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
