Existing law requires the department to transmit to the Secretary of State specified information related to a person's eligibility to vote, which the person provides when applying for a driver's license or identification card or when the person notifies the department of an address change. Existing law requires that if this information transmitted to the Secretary of State constitutes a completed affidavit of registration, the Secretary of State must register or preregister the person to vote, as applicable, unless the person affirmatively declines to register or is ineligible to vote, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the department from providing a person the opportunity to attest to meeting voter eligibility requirements when they submit a driver's license application if the person provides a document to the department during the transaction demonstrating that the person is not a United States citizen, and would prohibit the department from providing records of that person to the Secretary of State."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
