The Small Business Procurement and Contract Act establishes a minimum goal of 25% procurement participation for small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction of state facilities. The Small Business Procurement and Contract Act requires that state agencies awarding contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction give 5% bid preferences, as specified, to small business and microbusiness bidders. The California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program requires state departments that award contracts to establish 3% participation goals for certain types of contracts for certified disabled veteran business enterprises, as defined. \n\nThis bill would require an awarding department, defined to include a state agency or department, to provide a bid preference of a prescribed percentage, as specified, in the award of contracts to contractors that set equity metrics. The bill would prohibit awarding a preference to a noncompliant bidder and would also prohibit the preference from being used to achieve any applicable minimum requirements. The bill would require the Department of General Services to adopt rules and regulations for the purpose of implementing these provisions."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Construction: workforce development: public contracts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
