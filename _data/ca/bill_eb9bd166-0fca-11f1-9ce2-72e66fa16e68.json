Existing law requires the Attorney General to prepare a ballot title and summary for each measure that the Secretary of State determines will appear on the ballot at a statewide election.\n\nThis bill would instead require the Legislative Analyst to carry out these responsibilities. The bill would make the operation of this requirement contingent upon approval by the voters of SCA 3 of the 2025\u201326 Regular Session.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements. The act also provides that, notwithstanding this requirement, the Legislature may add to the voter information guide information regarding candidates or other information.\n\nThis bill, which would permit or require additional information to be included in the voter information guide, would therefore require a majority vote."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
