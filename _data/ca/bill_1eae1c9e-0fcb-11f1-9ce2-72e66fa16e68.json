Chapter 624 of the Statutes of 2022 (SB 1436) limited the respiratory tasks and services that a licensed vocational nurse may perform to basic respiratory tasks and services that do not require a respiratory assessment and only require manual, technical skills, or data collection, as identified by the Respiratory Care Board of California, as specified. SB 1436 and subsequent legislation have created exemptions for a licensed vocational nurse to perform respiratory tasks and services under specified circumstances that vary depending on the task or service, the nurse's training, demonstrated competency, and employer, and the setting in which the task or service is performed, as provided. SB 1436 became effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nThis bill, instead, would authorize a licensed vocational nurse to perform respiratory tasks and services consistent with the scope of practice of a licensed vocational nurse, as it existed on December 31, 2022. The bill would make various conforming changes, including removal of the above-described exemptions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
