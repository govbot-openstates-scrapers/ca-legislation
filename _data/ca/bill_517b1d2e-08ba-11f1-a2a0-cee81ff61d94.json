Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2021, to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders, as defined, under the same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions.\n\nThis bill would generally require a large group health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, to reimburse an eligible enrollee or insured for up to 12 visits with a behavioral health provider if the enrollee or insured lives in a county where a local or state emergency has been declared due to wildfires and the enrollee or insured has experienced a loss, trauma, or displacement because of the fire. The bill would prohibit these benefits from being subject to utilization review. The bill would require a health care service plan contract or health insurer to provide notice to all affected enrollees of these provisions, as specified. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
