The Sales and Use Tax Law provides various exemptions from those taxes. \n\nThis bill would, on and after January 1, 2027, and before January 1, 2032, exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, infant car seats, as defined.\n\nExisting law requires a bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.\n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by the bill does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes. \n\nExisting law imposes or dedicates certain state sales and use tax rates for local funding, including through the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Existing law requires the state to reimburse counties and cities for revenue losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions. \n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them pursuant to this bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
