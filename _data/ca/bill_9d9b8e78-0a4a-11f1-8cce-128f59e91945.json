In this connection, the bill would authorize a local agency, as defined, to establish a Small Business Utilization Program (SBUP) to increase small businesses' participation in local agency procurement opportunities.\n\nThis bill would require an SBUP, to facilitate the participation of small businesses in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the local agency, to establish a small business certification process. As part of this process, the bill would require the SBUP, to the extent feasible, to include all of specified criteria, including, among other things, a minimum goal of 25% procurement participation for small businesses certification. The bill would authorize a local agency that establishes an SBUP to engage in specified activities to facilitate contract awards to small businesses.\n\nThis bill would authorize a local agency to submit information on its small business procurement participation to the Office of Small Business Advocate, including progress toward meeting utilization goals.

Existing law sets forth the criteria that an applicant must meet to be eligible to participate in the program. Existing law authorizes specified state funding provided pursuant to these provisions to be used for outreach efforts.\n\nThis bill would remove provisions that require an applicant to provide a plan of action and commitment to fully draw down all specified federal funds available to it, that authorize the office to require an applicant to provide details relating to the source and amount of nonstate funds, and that require an applicant to demonstrate the ability to fully draw down substantially all federal and private funds available to it in order to be eligible to participate in the program. The bill would authorize an applicant to utilize federal and private funding contracts, as specified.
