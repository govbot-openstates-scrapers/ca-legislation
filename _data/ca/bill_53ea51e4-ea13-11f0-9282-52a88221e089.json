The act further provides for the certification of local coastal programs by the California Coastal Commission. The act provides various procedures related to development control within areas of the coastal zone.\n\nThis bill would require a coastal development permit associated with the Zero Emissions Port Electrification and Operations project, as defined, to be considered to be within the boundaries of the Los Angeles Harbor District, and would provide the Los Angeles Harbor Department the sole authority to review the permit application and issue an associated coastal development permit on behalf of all jurisdictions ordinarily required to review the application. By placing additional duties on the Los Angeles Harbor District and the Los Angeles Harbor Department regarding the review and approval of coastal development permits for the project, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would require any additional development project to install infrastructure or purchase or deploy equipment at a terminal within the boundary of the Port of Los Angeles's Port Master Plan that is not exempt from a coastal development permit to acquire a separate coastal development permit in conformity with the Port of Los Angeles's Port Master Plan. The bill would require the appropriate state agency to render a decision on an application for a permit required for the project, or an additional project associated with the completion of the project, within 90 days of submission of the application and, if no action is taken by the appropriate state agency within that time period, would provide that the permit shall be deemed issued.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Conservation Corps."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
