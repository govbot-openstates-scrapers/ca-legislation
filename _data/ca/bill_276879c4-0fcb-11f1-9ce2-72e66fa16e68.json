Existing law prohibits a community college district baccalaureate degree program from offering a baccalaureate degree program or program curricula already offered by the California State University or the University of California.\n\nThis bill would instead prohibit a community college district baccalaureate degree program from offering a baccalaureate degree program or program curricula substantially similar to a baccalaureate degree program offered by the California State University or the University of California within the geographic region served by the community college district, except where the California State University or the University of California does not enroll students from that geographic region in the same degree pathway or where documented unmet regional workforce needs justify the program.\n\nExisting law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to consult with and seek feedback from the Chancellor of the California State University, the President of the University of California, and the President of the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities on proposed baccalaureate degree programs, as specified. Existing law authorizes the California State University and the University of California to assess whether proposed baccalaureate degree programs are duplicative of existing baccalaureate programs offered by state universities. If the California State University or the University of California believes there is program duplication, existing law requires them to submit written objections with supporting evidence to the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges within 30 working days of receipt of the proposal, and requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, within 30 working days after receiving the written objections, to convene with the applicant and the segment or segments that raised an objection to collaborate and establish a written agreement before the program is approved.\n\nThis bill would instead require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to consult and seek feedback from the Chancellor of the California State University and the President of the University of California regarding proposed baccalaureate degree programs that may be substantially similar to California State University or University of California programs offered within the geographic region of the proposing community college district. If the California State University or the University of California believes there is substantial similarity within the geographic region, the bill would authorize them to submit a written objection with supporting evidence, and upon receipt of the objection, would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to convene the applicant and the objector to establish a written agreement before the program is approved."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
