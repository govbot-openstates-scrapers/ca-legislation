The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law, the Medi-Cal Long-Term Care Reimbursement Act, requires the department, subject to any necessary federal approvals, for managed care rating periods that begin between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2026, inclusive, to establish and implement the Workforce and Quality Incentive Program. Under that program, a network provider furnishing skilled nursing facility services to a Medi-Cal managed care enrollee is authorized to earn performance-based directed payments from the Medi-Cal managed care plan with which they contract, as specified, in addition to other certain payments.\n\nThis bill would remove from the above-described provision the qualification that the provider be within the network. The bill would make conforming changes to related provisions. Under the bill, pursuant to conditions of eligibility for directed payments under certain federal regulations, payments made under the Workforce and Quality Incentive Program would be retroactively calculated and paid based on the total number of days, effective July 9, 2024, during which the facility provided services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries, regardless of whether the facility was a network provider."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Juveniles: dependency."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
