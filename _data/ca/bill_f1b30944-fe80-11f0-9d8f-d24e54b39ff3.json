Existing law sets forth various general powers of the department in implementing these programs, including authorizing the department to enter into long-term contracts or agreements of up to 30 years for the purpose of servicing loans or grants or enforcing regulatory agreements or other security documents.\n\nExisting law requires the department, subject to certain conditions, to allow property owners subject to a regulatory agreement with the department to take out additional debt on the development in order to finance, with the department's approval, the rehabilitation of the property or investment in new affordable housing. Under existing law, one of those conditions is that any extracted equity is required to meet at least one of several conditions, as specified. Existing law defines \"extracted equity\" for these purposes to mean debt added to a department-regulated property that is not used in prescribed ways.\n\nThis bill would, additionally, require the department to allow property owners to take out additional debt, as described above, if any extracted equity is utilized for reimbursement of borrower advances for predevelopment costs, unreimbursed capital improvements, and unreimbursed operating deficits. The bill would revise the definition of \"extracted equity\" to mean debt distributed funds that are financed with debt that is secured by a department-regulated property and is not used in prescribed ways."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
