Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to adjudge a person under these circumstances to be a ward of the court. Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to permit a person adjudged a ward of the juvenile court, or placed on probation by the juvenile court, to reside in a county other than their county of legal residence. Existing law authorizes a ward who is permitted to reside in a county other than their county of legal residence to be supervised by the probation officer of the county of actual residence, with the consent of that probation officer.\n\nThis bill would clarify that these provisions apply to wards discharged to probation supervision after having been confined in a secure youth treatment facility, or after having been transferred to a less restrictive program from a secure youth treatment facility."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
