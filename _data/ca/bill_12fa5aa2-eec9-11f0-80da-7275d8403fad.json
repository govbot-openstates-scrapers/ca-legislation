The act requires 2 supervisors from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to serve on the SANDAG board of directors. The act refers to these directors as primary and secondary representatives. The act requires one of these directors to be from a district that is substantially an incorporated area and the other to be from a district that is substantially an unincorporated area.\n\nThis bill would replace the secondary representative from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on the SANDAG board of directors with a resident of an unincorporated area of the County of San Diego that is selected by, and subject to recall by, a majority of the community planning groups in the County of San Diego. The bill would provide for an alternative to serve on the SANDAG board of directors if the secondary representative is not available. The bill would eliminate the requirement that one of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on the SANDAG board of directors be from a district that is substantially an incorporated area and the other to be from a district that is substantially an unincorporated area. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "San Diego Association of Governments."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
