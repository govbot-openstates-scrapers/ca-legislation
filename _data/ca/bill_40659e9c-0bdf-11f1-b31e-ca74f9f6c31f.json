Existing law makes it a crime for a person required to register as a sex offender under the act to willfully violate any requirement of the act. \n\nThis bill would additionally require a person who is discharged or paroled from a secure youth treatment facility to register. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
