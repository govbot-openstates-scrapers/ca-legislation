Existing law requires a confidential marriage license to be issued by the county clerk, as specified, and then returned to the county clerk after the marriage has been solemnized. Existing law requires the county clerk to maintain a confidential marriage certificate as a permanent record that is not open to public inspection except upon order of the court issued upon a showing of good cause. Existing law requires the clerk to keep an original certificate of confidential marriage for one year from the date of filing, and authorizes the clerk, after one year, to reproduce the certificate and dispose of the original, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
