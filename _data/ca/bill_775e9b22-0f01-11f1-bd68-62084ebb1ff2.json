The notice of intention must contain a statement of the reasons for the proposed recall.\n\nThis bill would require the proponents of the recall to sign the statement of reasons under penalty of perjury. By requiring the statement to be signed under penalty of perjury, the bill would create a new crime and therefore establish a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law requires a recall petition for a local officer to be submitted to the elections official within a specified number of days after the clerk notifies the proponents that the form and wording of the petition comply with certain requirements. The number of days depends upon the number of registered voters in the electoral jurisdiction.\n\n For the recall of a superior court judge, this bill would instead require the petition to be submitted within 80 days after the clerk notifies the proponents, regardless of the number of registered voters in the electoral jurisdiction.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
