Under existing law, this crime is punishable as a misdemeanor or in state prison as a felony.\n\nThis bill would, for the purposes of sentencing for a felony violation of these provisions, authorize the court to consider, as a factor in aggravation, that the defendant willfully threatened to commit a crime that would result in the death or great bodily injury of a person the defendant knew was a state constitutional officer, a Member of the Legislature, or a judge or court commissioner, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Courts: obstruction of justice."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
