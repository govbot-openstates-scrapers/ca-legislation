The bill would define \"arrangement for prospective employment\" as an agreement pursuant to which a prospective employer's offer of employment has been accepted by the prospective employee.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.\n\nA violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 is punishable as a misdemeanor. By creating new disclosure requirements and therefore creating new crimes under the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Political Reform Act of 1974: Fair Political Practices Commission."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
