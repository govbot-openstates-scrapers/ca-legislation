If the court determines that the proceeding was not brought in good faith or with reasonable cause, existing law requires the court to decide the reasonable and necessary defense costs incurred by party opposing the proceeding and to render judgment in favor of that party. Existing law applies these provisions only if the defendant or cross-defendant has made a motion for summary judgment, a motion for directed verdict, a motion for judgment in a nonjury trial, or nonsuit.\n\nThis bill would expand the above provision to apply to a demurrer brought by a defendant or cross-defendant."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
