Under existing state law, each qualified political party is required to notify the Secretary of State of the names of the party's nominees for President and Vice President on or before the 75th day before a presidential general election. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to cause the names of each party's nominees for President and Vice President to be placed upon the ballot for the election.\n\nThis bill would require a representative of each qualified political party to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the party's nominees for President and Vice President are both qualified to be elected President under the Twenty-Second Amendment. If that certification is not made, the bill would prohibit placing the names of the party's nominees for President and Vice President upon the ballot for the ensuing general election. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
