Existing law establishes the 988 State Suicide and Behavioral Health Crisis Services Fund and provides that 988 surcharge revenue in the fund is available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the act.\n\nThis bill would require OES to, no later than July 1, 2027, ensure that technology enabling transfers between 988 centers and a subnetwork of LGBTQ+ specialized youth suicide prevention service providers is available, as specified, and that callers may dial 988 and press \"3\" to be automatically routed to an LGBTQ+ suicide prevention specialist. The bill would also require OES to, no later than December 1, 2027, ensure that technologies enabling text or chat contacts between a caller and 988 centers or a specified subnetwork are available.\n\nThis bill would require the California Health and Human Services Agency to, no later than July 1, 2027, administer a grant program for qualified entities that specialize in suicide prevention services and provide funding for state 988 call centers to implement specified goals. The bill would require the agency to determine the eligibility criteria, as prescribed, grant application process, and methodology for the distribution of grants to a qualified entity. The bill would require a qualified entity to annually file an expenditure and outcomes report, as specified, in a form and manner determined by the agency. The bill would specify that moneys in the 988 State Suicide and Behavioral Health Crisis Services Fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of these provisions. The bill would provide that a qualified entity selected, contracted, or funded under these provisions is recognized as part of California's 988 network for all state administrative, operational, and interoperability purposes when receiving or responding to a 988 call, text, or chat routed through 988.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
