Existing law establishes the California Safe Homes grant program to be developed by the department to, among other things, reduce local and statewide wildfire losses. Existing law requires the department to prioritize specified needs when awarding grant funds and requires eligible program applicants, which include individuals, cities, counties, and special districts, to meet specified criteria.\n\nThis bill would, for purposes of the program, require the department to develop standardized procedures and processes for the selection of contractors and award of grant funds to perform specified categories of wildfire mitigation work. The bill would impose specified wage requirements on a contractor who performs any work under these procedures and processes. The bill would prohibit a contractor from being prequalified for, shortlisted for, or awarded a contract unless they provide an enforceable commitment that they will use a skilled and trained workforce to perform all work that falls within an apprenticeable occupation in the building and construction trades, as specified. The bill would impose various requirements on contractors and subcontractors, including requiring each to hold a valid, applicable license issued by the appropriate regulatory entity in this state for the specific task being funded by the program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
