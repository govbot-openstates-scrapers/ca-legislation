Existing law imposes various fees on applicants for licensure of physicians and surgeons, including an application and processing fee of $625 to be paid by an applicant for a certificate based on reciprocity, and an applicant for a certificate based upon written examination, as specified. Under existing law, all moneys paid to and received by the board are required to be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the Contingent Fund of the Medical Board of California. Existing law requires moneys in that fund to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the Medical Board of California to expedite the licensure process for an applicant who submits an application that is accompanied by, among other things, payment of an expedite fee fixed by the board at an amount equal to the cost of expediting the licensure process, not to exceed $250, as specified. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2030."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
