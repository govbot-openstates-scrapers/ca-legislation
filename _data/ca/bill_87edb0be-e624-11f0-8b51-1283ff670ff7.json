This bill would make a local government or law enforcement agency liable for a civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation of these provisions.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
