Existing law authorizes the court to make any reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the ward, including ordering the ward to be on probation without the supervision of the probation officer or ordering the care, custody, and control of the ward to be under the supervision of the probation officer who may place the ward in specified out-of-home placements. Existing law limits to 12 months from the most recent disposition hearing the period of time a ward may remain on probation, except, among other things, the limit does not apply to a ward ordered under the supervision of the probation officer for placement in specified out-of-home placements and a ward who is transferred or discharged from a secure youth treatment facility.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to expand these limitations on the probationary period to apply to youth in out-of-home placements and to youth transitioning from secure youth treatment facilities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
