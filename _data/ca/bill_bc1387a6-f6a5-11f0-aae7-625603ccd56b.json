{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB809", "title": "Employees and independent contractors: construction trucking.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Employeesandindependentcontractors", "constructiontrucking"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law, as established in the case of Dynamex Operations W. v. Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 903 (Dynamex) , creates a presumption that a worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits arising under wage orders issued by the Industrial Welfare Commission. Existing law requires a 3-part test, commonly known as the \"ABC\" test, to determine if workers are employees or independent contractors for those purposes.\n\nExisting law establishes that, for purposes of the Labor Code, the Unemployment Insurance Code, and the wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission, a person providing labor or services for remuneration is considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business, and the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. This test is commonly known as the \"ABC\" test, as described above. Existing law charges the Labor Commissioner with the enforcement of labor laws, including worker classification.\n\nExisting law exempts specified occupations and business relationships from the application of Dynamex and the provisions described above. \n\nThis bill would provide that mere ownership of a vehicle, including a personal vehicle or a commercial vehicle, used by a person in providing labor or services for remuneration does not make that person an independent contractor. The bill would state that this provision is declarative of existing law.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program administered by the Labor Commissioner and the Employment Development Department. Pursuant to the program, notwithstanding any law, a motor carrier performing drayage services may be relieved of liability for statutory or civil penalties associated with the misclassification of commercial drivers as independent contractors if the motor carrier enters into a settlement agreement with the commissioner, with the cooperation and consent of the department, prior to January 1, 2017, whereby the motor carrier agrees to classify all of its commercial drivers as employees, and the settlement agreement contains prescribed components, including, but not limited to, an agreement by the motor carrier to pay all wages, benefits, and taxes owed, if any. \n\nThis bill would establish a similar program, known as the Construction Trucking Employer Amnesty Program, to be administered by the commissioner and the department. Under the bill, an eligible construction contractor would be relieved of liability for statutory or civil penalties, except as provided, associated with the misclassification of construction drivers as independent contractors, if the eligible construction contractor executes a settlement agreement negotiated with, or approved by, the commissioner prior to January 1, 2029, whereby the eligible construction contractor agrees to properly classify all drivers performing construction work on their behalf as employees and the settlement agreement contains prescribed components, including, but not limited to, an agreement by the construction contractor to pay all wages, benefits, and taxes owed, if any. If a construction driver declines to accept the terms of a settlement agreement, the bill would still require an eligible construction contractor to reclassify the construction driver as an employee and the construction driver would be precluded from pursuing a claim for civil or statutory penalties under specified provisions of law for a claim arising during the period of time covered by the settlement agreement.\n\n(3) Existing law requires an employer to indemnify their employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties, or of their obedience to the directions of the employer, as provided.\n\nThis bill would provide that the duty of an employer to indemnify their employee for all necessary expenses or losses applies to the use of a vehicle owned by an employee and used by that employee in the discharge of their duties. The bill would provide that, with respect to construction trucking, a commercial motor vehicle driver who owns the truck, tractor, trailer, or other commercial vehicle that they use in the discharge of their duties as an employee working for an employer would be entitled to reimbursement for the use, upkeep, and depreciation of that truck, tractor, trailer, or other commercial vehicle, as provided. The bill would state that specified provisions described above are declarative of existing law."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
