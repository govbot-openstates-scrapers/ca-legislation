The law deems the substantial failure of the management of a mobilehome park, as defined, to provide and maintain physical improvements in the common facilities in good working order and condition, and the substantial violation of a mobilehome park rule, to be a public nuisance that may be remedied only by a civil action or abatement, as specified. The law authorizes a civil action for purposes of that provision to be brought by, among others, the Attorney General.\n\nExisting law establishes within the Department of Housing and Community Development the Mobilehome Residency Law Protection Program, which authorizes additional enforcement measures for violations of the Mobilehome Residency Law. Existing law requires the department to refer any alleged violations of law or regulations within the department's jurisdiction to the Division of Codes and Standards within the department, and to refer any alleged violations of law or regulations that are not within the jurisdiction of the department, as specified, to the appropriate enforcement agency.\n\nThis bill would require the department to refer up to a total of 25 alleged violations of the Mobilehome Residency Law to the office of the Attorney General in any given fiscal year that the department in good faith efforts selects as the most severe, deleterious, and materially and economically impactful alleged violations. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to arbitrate, mediate, negotiate, or pursue any and all available judicial remedies in connection with any alleged violations of the law referred by the department. \n\nExisting law creates the Mobilehome Dispute Resolution Fund, as specified, and requires moneys in the fund to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of implementing the program.\n\nThis bill would require moneys in the fund to be made available to the department or to the Attorney General, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of implementing the program. The bill would require the Attorney General to use funds appropriated to it as necessary to perform duties related to enforcing the alleged violations described above.\n\nExisting law requires the department to submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature outlining, among other things, the amount of registration fees collected and the amount expended on the program. \n\nThis bill would additionally require the department to include the amount expended by the Attorney General, as specified, and the number of complaint allegations referred to the Attorney General, as specified, in the annual report. \n\nExisting law repeals the above-described provisions relating to the Mobilehome Residency Law Protection Program on January 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would extend that repeal date to January 1, 2030."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
