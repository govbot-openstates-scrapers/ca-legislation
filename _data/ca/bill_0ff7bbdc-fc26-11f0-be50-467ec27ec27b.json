Under existing law, a person who violates certain provisions related to the regulation and supervision of dams and reservoirs or of any approval, order, rule, regulation, or requirement of the Department of Water Resources is guilty of a misdemeanor, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the release of stored water from a reservoir owned and operated by the United States in this state if the release is done under false pretenses, which the bill would define to mean a release of water from a reservoir owned and operated by the United States in a manner that is knowingly, designedly, and intentionally under any false or fraudulent representation as to the purpose and intended use of the water. The bill would authorize the State Water Resources Control Board or the Attorney General, as provided, to bring an action for injunctive relief for a violation of the above-described prohibition. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Water infrastructure: dams and reservoirs."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
