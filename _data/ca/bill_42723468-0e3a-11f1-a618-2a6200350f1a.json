Existing law requires a lienholder to apply to the Department of Motor Vehicles for the issuance of an authorization to conduct a lien sale, upon an application that is to be executed under penalty of perjury.\n\nThis bill would increase the above-described vehicle value threshold from $4,000 to $7,000. Commencing January 1, 2030, and triennially thereafter, the bill would require the Director of Motor Vehicles to adjust that value to reflect changes in inflation, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
