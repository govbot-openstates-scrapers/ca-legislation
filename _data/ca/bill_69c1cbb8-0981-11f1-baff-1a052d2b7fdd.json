Under existing law, a violation of this provision is punishable as a misdemeanor or felony.\n\nThis bill would make a violation of the above provision punishable only as a felony.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
