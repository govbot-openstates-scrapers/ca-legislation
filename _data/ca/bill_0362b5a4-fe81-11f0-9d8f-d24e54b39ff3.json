Existing law requires the commission to establish procedures for accepting complaints from members of the public regarding peace officers or law enforcement agencies that may be investigated. Existing law establishes, within the commission, the Peace Officer Standards Accountability Division and requires the division, among other things, to bring proceedings seeking the suspension or revocation of certification of a peace officer.\n\nExisting law, the California Public Records Act, generally requires public records to be open for inspection by the public. Existing law provides numerous exceptions to this requirement. Under existing law, the personnel records of peace officers and custodial officers are confidential and not subject to public inspection. Existing law provides certain exemptions to this confidentiality, including the reports, investigations, and findings of certain incidents involving the use of force by a peace officer.\n\nThis bill would additionally exempt agreements between an employing agency and a peace officer that, among other things, require the agency to destroy, remove, or conceal a record of a misconduct investigation. The bill would declare that its provisions are severable.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 832.7 of the Penal Code proposed by AB 847 and AB 1178, to be operative only if this bill and AB 847 or AB 1178 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\nThe California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Law enforcement: settlement agreements: prohibition."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
