{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB973", "title": "Recycling: plastic trash bags: plastic packaging and products.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Recycling", "plasticpackagingandproducts", "plastictrashbags"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, creates a program for the recycling of rigid plastic packaging containers. The program defines \"rigid plastic packaging container\" to mean a plastic package having a relatively inflexible finite shape or form, with a capacity between 8 fluid ounces and 5 fluid gallons, that is capable of maintaining its shape while holding other products, including, but not limited to, bottles, cartons, and other receptacles, for sale or distribution in the state. The program generally requires a rigid plastic packaging container sold or offered for sale in this state to meet one of specified criteria, including, but not limited to, having been made from 25% postconsumer material or being a reusable package or a refillable package, unless a waiver or an exemption applies. Notwithstanding these provisions, the program deems a manufacturer in compliance with the program if the manufacturer demonstrates that it, or another company under the same corporate ownership, either consumed or arranged for the purchase and consumption of certain amounts of postconsumer material generated in the state for the manufacture of rigid plastic packaging containers or other plastic products or packaging not subject to the program, as provided.\n\nThe program makes a violation of these provisions a public offense punishable by a fine of not more than $100,000. The program also subjects a violation of these provisions to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000, as provided. The program requires the department to deposit all penalties and fines into the Rigid Container Account in the Integrated Waste Management Fund in the State Treasury. The program requires the moneys in the account to be expended by the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to assist local governmental agencies to develop and implement collection and processing systems for the recycling of materials covered by the program, for the development of markets for these materials, and for the department's costs of implementing the program. The program requires the department to adopt regulations to implement the program, as provided.\n\nThis bill would repeal the program and replace it with a new program for recycling plastic packaging and products. The bill would require, on or before July 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, a manufacturer of a covered product, as defined, to pay an annual registration charge and to register with the department, as specified. The bill would require a manufacturer to provide certain information during registration, including, but not limited to, the brand name of each of the manufacturer's covered products. The bill would subject a manufacturer that is not in compliance with the registration requirement to an administrative civil penalty of not more than $5,000 per day per violation, as specified. The bill would, on and after January 1, 2029, require a manufacturer to include, as part of its annual registration, proof of third-party certification of the postconsumer recycled content of each of its covered products. The bill would require the third-party certification to be provided under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require a manufacturer to meet certain annual minimum postconsumer recycled content percentages for covered products, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to grant a waiver for up to 2 years, upon application, from these requirements, as specified. The bill would require certain information to be included in a waiver application and would require a waiver application charge not to exceed $1,000. The bill would require the department to assess an administrative civil penalty for a violation on a per-pound basis for each pound of virgin material that was used by a manufacturer in its products instead of the minimum postconsumer recycled content, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to reduce this administrative civil penalty if the manufacturer submits, and the department approves, a corrective action plan, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to deposit all penalties and fines paid pursuant to the program into the Rigid Container Account, which this bill would continue in existence. The bill would require moneys deposited into the account to be expended by the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to assist local governmental agencies to develop and implement collection and processing systems for the recycling of materials that are subject to the program, for the development of markets for these materials, and for the department's actual and reasonable costs of implementing the program.\n\nThis bill would require, on and after April 1, 2028, a manufacturer to provide to the department, in a format and manner prescribed by the department, an annual report that includes specified information regarding amounts and types of plastics used in covered products. The bill would exempt confidential and proprietary information, collected by the department from manufacturers for purpose of the program, from disclosure pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\n\nThis bill would authorize a manufacturer to authorize an organization to act on its behalf in complying with certain requirements, including, but not limited to, registration and annual reporting requirements. The bill would exempt certain covered products from the program, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to adopt regulations to implement and enforce the program, as specified. The bill would require the department to establish an electronic registration process on its internet website.\n\n(2) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 requires a manufacturer of certain plastic trash bags to ensure that the recycled plastic postconsumer material in the bag is equal to at least 10% of the weight of the bag, or that at least 30% of the weight of the material used in all of the manufacturer's plastic products is recycled plastic postconsumer material, as provided. Existing law requires a manufacturer of a plastic trash bag to submit an annual report to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery certifying compliance with these postconsumer materials requirements, as specified. Existing law requires the department to survey manufacturers and report to the Legislature on, among others, the quantity of recycled plastic postconsumer material provided by suppliers within the state and the quantity of the material provided by suppliers outside the state. Existing law requires a wholesaler of plastic trash bags to annually certify to the department the name and physical location of each manufacturer from whom it purchased plastic trash bags, as provided. Existing law authorizes the department to adopt regulations to implement these provision, as specified. Existing law prohibits a supplier, manufacturer, or wholesaler, as provided, that is not in compliance with these provisions from being eligible for a state contract or subcontract, as provided.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions.\n\n(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Recycling: plastic packaging and products."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
