{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB2419", "title": "Probation officers: body-worn cameras: County of Los Angeles.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["CountyofLosAngeles", "Probationofficers", "body-worncameras"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law subjects a minor between 12 and 17 years of age, who violates any federal, state, or local law or ordinance, and a minor under 12 years of age who is alleged to have committed specified serious offenses, to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge the minor to be a ward of the court. Existing law assigns various responsibilities relating to these individuals to the probation officer, including, among others, the responsibility to supervise minors placed on probation. \n\nThis bill would require the County of Los Angeles to implement a body-worn camera program for the County of Los Angeles Probation Department (probation department) . The bill would require the county, the probation department, and affected employee organizations to develop the body-worn camera policy and a plan for implementing the body-worn camera program by no later than June 1, 2027. The bill would require the body-worn camera program to be implemented beginning on January 1, 2028. The bill would specify the minimum requirements for the policy, including the best practices for officer review of recorded body-worn camera data. Because this bill would create new duties for the County of Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles Probation Department, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
