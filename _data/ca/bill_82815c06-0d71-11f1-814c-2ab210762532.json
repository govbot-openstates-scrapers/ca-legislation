The act defines \"drug testing devices\" for this purpose to mean specified devices designed to detect the presence of controlled substances in a drink. The act requires the department to post on its internet website a link to a page that contains information about these requirements.\n\nThe act repeals these requirements on January 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would repeal the January 1, 2027, sunset date, thereby indefinitely extending these requirements."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
