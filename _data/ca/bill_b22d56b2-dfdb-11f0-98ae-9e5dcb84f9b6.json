The bill would require this information to be updated at least once per quarter. The bill would require animal shelters with internet websites to post this information on their internet websites and would require that this information remain publicly accessible for at least 5 years. The bill would require animal shelters that do not have internet websites to make this information publicly available, upon request, for at least 5 years.\n\nTo the extent that this bill would impose a new program or higher level of service on public animal control agencies or shelters, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
