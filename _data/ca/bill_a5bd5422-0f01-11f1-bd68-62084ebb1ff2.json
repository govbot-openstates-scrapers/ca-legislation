The bill would require each state agency, as described above, to create, adopt, and post on its internet website a plain language policy that identifies how the state agency will incorporate or strengthen plain language writing and design principles and practices. The bill would require the head of each state agency to, among other things, designate one or more senior officials within the state agency to oversee state agency implementation of these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
