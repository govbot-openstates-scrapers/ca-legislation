Existing law authorizes air districts to adopt and implement regulations to reduce or mitigate emissions from indirect sources of air pollution.\n\nExisting law requires the state board to adopt rules and regulations relating to vehicular emissions standards, as specified, that will achieve the ambient air quality standards required by federal law in conjunction with other measures adopted by the state board, air districts, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThis bill would authorize the state board, if necessary to carry out that duty to achieve those ambient air quality standards, to adopt regulations to reduce or mitigate emissions from indirect sources of pollution.\n\nExisting law makes any violation of a rule or regulation of the state board relating to nonvehicular air pollution control a misdemeanor.\n\nBecause a violation of these regulations of the state board with respect to nonvehicular sources subject to those regulations would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
