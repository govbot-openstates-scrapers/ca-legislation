Existing law provides that an entity submitting a timber harvesting plan, as prescribed, is deemed to have given notice to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law specifies that the Department of Fish and Wildlife is not required to issue an agreement fewer than 60 days from the date the notification is complete.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue an agreement within 5 working days of the approval of a timber harvesting plan by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act requires a California regional water quality control board to prescribe waste discharge requirements for the discharge of pollutants into state waters and authorizes the regional board to prescribe general waste discharge requirements for a category of discharges if the regional board finds or determines that certain criteria apply to the discharges in that category.\n\nThis bill would require, for a regional board that has adopted general waste discharge requirements for timber harvesting, the regional board to authorize timber harvesting operations performed consistent with an approved timber harvesting plan subject to those general waste discharge requirements within 5 working days of receiving a complete request."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
