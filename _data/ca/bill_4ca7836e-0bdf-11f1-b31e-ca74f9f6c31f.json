For those purposes, existing law requires the office to, among other things, develop a balanced, multimodal research and development program designed to identify, research, test, and evaluate emerging technologies and tools designed to improve the state's preparation for, and response to, wildfires in the state, as specified. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2029.\n\nThis bill would extend the repeal date of the above provisions to January 1, 2031.\n\n(2) Existing law, upon appropriation of the Legislature, requires the Office of Emergency Services to enter into a joint powers agreement with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to develop and administer a comprehensive wildfire mitigation program. Existing law requires the department to delegate its duties and responsibilities for this program to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. Existing law requires the State Fire Marshal, in consultation with other officials, to identify measures eligible for financial assistance under the wildfire mitigation program that are both cost effective and provide for appropriate site or structure fire risk reduction, as specified. Existing law requires the joint powers authority to develop eligibility criteria for property owners, community organizations, and local governments who may receive financial assistance under the wildfire mitigation program. Existing law requires the joint powers authority to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the implementation of the wildfire mitigation financial assistance program that includes, among other things, an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the wildfire mitigation program compared to other structure hardening, defensible space, vegetation management, and fuel reduction incentive programs and an evaluation of the overall wildfire risk reduction achieved statewide through awards of financial assistance under the wildfire mitigation program. Existing law repeals these provisions on July 1, 2029.\n\nThis bill would extend the repeal date of the above provisions to July 1, 2031."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
