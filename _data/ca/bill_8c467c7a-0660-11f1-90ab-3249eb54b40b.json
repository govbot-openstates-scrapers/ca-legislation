The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nUnder the Medi-Cal Dental Provider Handbook, the maximum allowance for a house/extended care facility call under a specified billing code is $20.\n\nThis bill would require the department to increase the Medi-Cal reimbursement base rate for a house/extended care facility call in order to reflect the reasonable travel costs for purposes of delivering dental services in the patient's private residence or applicable facility instead of the location of the dental provider. The bill would require that the rate be adjusted to a minimum of $120 per patient per date of service, with subsequent readjustments every 2 years to account for inflation and provider cost data.\n\nThe bill would require the department, every 2 years, to report to the Legislature about the impact of the rate adjustments on access, utilization, and reductions in emergency department visits for dental conditions.\n\nThe bill would condition implementation of these provisions on an appropriation, receipt of any necessary federal approvals, and the availability of federal financial participation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
