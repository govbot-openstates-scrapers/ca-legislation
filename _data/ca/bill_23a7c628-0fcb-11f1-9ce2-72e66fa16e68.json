Existing law, known as the Golden State Scholarshare Trust Act, establishes the Golden State Scholarshare College Savings Trust (Scholarshare trust) , under the administration of the Scholarshare Investment Board, to provide financial aid for postsecondary education costs of participating students. Existing state and federal law generally includes in gross income distributions from a qualified tuition program, as defined to include the Scholarshare trust, except as provided.\n\nExisting federal law, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, excludes from gross income, for federal income tax purposes, distributions from a qualified tuition program that are made after December 31, 2023, and are paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a Roth IRA, as described.\n\nThe Personal Income Tax Law generally conforms to federal income tax law relating to qualified state tuition programs, except as specified. Among those exceptions, existing state law does not conform to the above-described exclusion for distributions from a qualified tuition program.\n\nThis bill would instead conform to that federal exclusion for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2030.\n\nThe Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows various deductions from gross income in calculating adjusted gross income.\n\nThis bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, would allow a deduction in determining adjusted gross income for contributions to a Scholarshare account by a qualified taxpayer, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires a bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
