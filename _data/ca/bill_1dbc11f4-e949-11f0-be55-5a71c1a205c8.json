The bill would require the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges to adopt a plan for up to 400 students who attend a campus of the University of California, the California State University, or the California Community Colleges to attend universities in Mexico and for 400 students who attend a university in Mexico to attend a campus of the University of California, the California State University, or the California Community Colleges. The bill would, among other things, require at least 10 campuses of the California State University to have an exchange program by January 1, 2027, and all campuses of the California State University and at a least one campus of each community college district to have an exchange program by January 1, 2029. By imposing additional duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges to coordinate curriculum for the exchange programs. The bill would also establish the California-Mexico Higher Education Development and Academic Exchange Program Fund in the State Treasury to fund the program, as provided. The bill would require the program to become operative only upon an appropriation of funds for its purposes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
