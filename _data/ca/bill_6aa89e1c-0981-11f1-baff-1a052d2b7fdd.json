Existing law requires each application for annual registration to be accompanied by a payment of a $40 fee for each fiscal year or portion of a fiscal year beginning on July 1.\n\nThis bill would authorize the secretary, after consulting with the Seed Advisory Board, to increase that fee to $100. The bill would authorize the secretary, on and after January 1, 2028, to, after consulting with the board, annually increase the fee by up to $50, but not to exceed $300 total, for each fiscal year or portion of a fiscal year beginning July 1.\n\nUnder existing law, the moneys collected pursuant to the seed law, including registration fees, assessments, and penalty revenues, are continuously appropriated to the Department of Food and Agriculture to carry out its provisions.\n\nBy authorizing the secretary to increase the amount of the annual registration fee, this bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
