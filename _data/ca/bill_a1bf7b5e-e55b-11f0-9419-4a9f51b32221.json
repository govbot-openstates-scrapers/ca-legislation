Existing law authorizes those review requirements to be met when every individual member of the board, or a subcommittee of the board consisting of the treasurer and at least one other board member, reviews the documents and statements independent of a board meeting, so long as the review is ratified at the board meeting subsequent to the review and that ratification is reflected in the minutes of that meeting.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions authorizing the review requirements to be met when individual members or a subcommittee of the board review the documents and statements independent of a board meeting as described above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
