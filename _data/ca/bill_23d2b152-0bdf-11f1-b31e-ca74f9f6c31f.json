Existing law prohibits a resolution, ordinance, contract, or contract amendment under CERL from providing retirement benefits for some, but not all, general members of a county or district.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a county or district whose officers and employees are enrolled as members of a retirement system under CERL from excluding from membership in the system any employee, group, or classification, other than those excludable officers and employees, as defined.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities and counties, including charter cities and charter counties.\n\n The bill would also include findings that its provisions are declaratory of existing law."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "County Employees Retirement Law of 1937."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
