The bill would require an ambulance operator, except as specified, that provides transport to police canines or search and rescue dogs injured in the line of duty to develop policies regarding the transport of these dogs. The bill would require these policies to be submitted to, and approved by, the local emergency medical services agency.\n\nExisting law requires emergency services and care to be provided to any person requesting the services or care, as specified. Existing law authorizes an emergency responder to provide basic first aid to dogs and cats, as specified, and exempts from civil liability specified emergency personnel who, in good faith and not for compensation, render emergency medical or nonmedical care, including to dogs and cats, at the scene of an emergency, as specified, resulting from any act or omission.\n\nThis bill would authorize an emergency responder to provide basic first aid to a police canine or search and rescue dog that is injured in the line of duty while the police canine or search and rescue dog is being transported to a veterinary clinic or similar facility, and would exempt that person from civil or criminal liability if they act in good faith and not for compensation to provide basic first aid to an injured police canine or search and rescue dog while the police canine or search and rescue dog is being transported to a veterinary clinic or similar facility, subject to a specified limitation.\n\nExisting law makes it unlawful for any person to practice veterinary medicine unless the person holds a valid license, as specified, subject to specified exemptions, including that an emergency responder may provide basic first aid to dogs and cats, as defined, to the extent that the provision of that care is not prohibited by the responder's employer.\n\nThis bill would make clarifying changes to those provisions authorizing an emergency provider to provide basic first aid to dogs and cats."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Emergency medical services: police canines."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
