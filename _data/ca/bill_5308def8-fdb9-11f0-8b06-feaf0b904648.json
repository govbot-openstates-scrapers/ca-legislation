Existing law continuously appropriates portions of the fund for various purposes.\n\nExisting law requires the state board to implement various programs to improve air quality, including air monitoring programs, grant programs, community emissions reduction programs, programs to reduce mobile and stationary sources of criteria air pollutants or toxic air contaminants, and various incentive programs to purchase or retrofit vehicles that meet specified criteria.\n\nThis bill would continuously appropriate 10% of the annual proceeds of the fund to the state board to provide funding for purposes of awarding grants, providing technical assistance, supporting community participation, and offering incentives in connection with specified programs to improve air quality, thereby making an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Air quality health planning."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
