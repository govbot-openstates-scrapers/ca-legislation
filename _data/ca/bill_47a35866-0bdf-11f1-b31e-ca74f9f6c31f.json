Existing law establishes a 21-member board of directors to govern the consolidated agency that includes, among others, 2 members of the Board of Supervisors of San Diego County.\n\nThis bill, the Give San Diego Rural Communities a Voice Act, would instead require the board of directors to include, among others, one member of the Board of Supervisors of San Diego County from an unincorporated area of the county and one representative from the Association of Planning Groups - San Diego County to be selected by their respective governing bodies. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Balanced Budget Accountability Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
