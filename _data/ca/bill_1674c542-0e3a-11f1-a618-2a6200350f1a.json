Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer to reimburse a complete claim or a portion thereof within 30 calendar days after receipt of the claim, or, if a claim or portion thereof does not meet the criteria for completeness, to notify the claimant no later than 30 calendar days after receipt that the claim or portion thereof is contested or denied.\n\nThis bill would grant a provider 90 days to submit a corrected claim after a health care service plan or health insurer denies a claim or sends a notice of overpayment for a claim based a defect that may be remedied by submitting a corrected claim. The bill would prohibit a plan or insurer from denying a corrected claim on the grounds that the provider did not submit the claim within the applicable claim filing deadline. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
