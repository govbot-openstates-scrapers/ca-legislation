For purposes of the transfer of a family home, that law requires the transfer to be of a principal residence of the transferor and to become the principal residence of the transferee within one year of the transfer. That law also requires the transferee to file for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption within a year of the transfer, as described.\n\nThis bill would provide that, in the event of a transfer to an eligible transferee as a result of the death of an eligible transferor by an order entered pursuant to specified existing law, the one-year periods described above shall be deemed to commence as of the effective date of the order, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property tax: tax-defaulted property sales: sales to public agencies."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
