The bill would make a violation of organized metal theft punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. The bill would make related findings and declarations and state the intent of the Legislature. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law encourages local law enforcement agencies to report thefts of commodity metals that have occurred within their jurisdiction to a specified privately maintained theft alert system to ensure that persons using the system receive timely and thorough information regarding metal thefts.\n\nThis bill would authorize local law enforcement agencies, public agencies, and private entities to provide information about theft of commodity metals to the Department of Justice and would require the department to make this information available to such local law enforcement agencies, public agencies, and private entities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
