{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1796", "title": "Licensed Commercial Interior Designer Practice Act.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["LicensedCommercialInteriorDesignerPracticeAct"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, until January 1, 2027, establishes a scheme for the certification of interior designers by the California Council for Interior Design Certification, a nonprofit organization, by obtaining a stamp from the council that identifies them as a certified interior designer, and makes it an unfair business practice for any person to represent or hold themselves out as a certified interior designer without a valid certification. Existing law also authorizes the council to issue a commercial designation to a person who satisfies specified requirements. Under the existing scheme, a certification under those provisions expires in 2 years unless renewed in a specified manner.\n\nExisting law, the Architects Practice Act, establishes the California Architects Board, consisting of 10 members, in the Department of Consumer Affairs to license and regulate the practice of architecture.\n\nThis bill would authorize the council to issue a commercial designation to a certified interior designer or qualified applicant only until ____, 2027, and would instead provide for the licensure and regulation of the practice of commercial interior design, as defined, by the board. The bill would add a member to the board who is a commercial interior designer, and would specify that the commercial interior designer member's term begins and expires on unspecified dates. The act would require the board to determine eligibility requirements, including examination and education requirements necessary for licensure. The bill would make it a misdemeanor, punishable by an unspecified fee or by imprisonment in a county jail, or both, to engage in certain acts, including engaging in the practice of commercial interior design without a license. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would exempt professional engineers, architects, land surveyors, and licensed contractors from the bill's provisions governing commercial interior design. The bill would require any stamp used by a licensed commercial interior designer to be of a design authorized by the board and would prescribe the information contained in the stamp. The bill would establish requirements for commercial interior instruments of service, as defined, and would prohibit a public entity from accepting commercial interior instruments of service submissions from an individual who is not a licensed commercial interior designer. By imposing requirements on local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would prescribe acts that are subject to discipline by the board and the manner of discipline, and would specify conditions of renewal and expiration of a license. The bill would require the board to fix certain fees relating to licensure at specified and unspecified amounts, to be deposited into the California Architects Board Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, and would authorize the board to create subaccounts within the fund, as specified. By adding a potential source of revenue to a continuously appropriated fund, and by authorizing increased expenditure of moneys from a continuously appropriated fund for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would also make an appropriation by requiring funds for the initial establishment and support of the regulatory activities affecting licensed commercial interior designers to be advanced from the General Fund. The bill would make other related and conforming changes to the Architects Practice Act and the provisions governing interior designers.\n\nExisting law allows a design professional, as defined, to claim a lien on certain works of improvement, as specified.\n\nThis bill would include licensed interior designers in the definition of \"design professional\" for purposes of the above-referenced lien provisions.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
