Existing law also authorizes a licensed vocational nurse, under the supervision of a credentialed school nurse, to assist an individual with exceptional needs who requires specialized physical health care with the basic respiratory services authorized by the Respiratory Care Practice Act.\n\nThis bill would repeal the authorization for a licensed vocational nurse, under the supervision of a credentialed school nurse, to assist an individual with exceptional needs with the above-described basic respiratory services authorized by the Respiratory Care Practice Act. The bill would instead authorize individuals, if they have the qualifications and meet the requirements referenced above for providing specialized physical health care services to an individual with exceptional needs, to provide a defined set of basic respiratory services to those individuals."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
