Existing law establishes a procedure by which a person committed as a sexually violent predator may petition for conditional release under the conditional release program, and requires the court, if it makes a specified determination, to place the person on conditional release. Existing law generally requires that a person released on conditional release pursuant to these provisions be placed in the person's county of domicile prior to their incarceration unless extraordinary circumstances exist requiring placement outside the county and notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed placement is given to the designated county of placement, as specified. Existing law requires the State Department of State Hospitals, or its designee, to consider specified factors when recommending a specific placement for community outpatient treatment, including the concerns and proximity of the victim or the victim's next of kin and the age and profile of the victim or victims in the sexually violent offenses committed by the person subject to placement.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of State Hospitals to, on or before January 1, 2027, conduct an analysis of the benefits and feasibility of establishing transitional housing facilities for the conditional release program, and to submit the findings of the analysis in a report to the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
