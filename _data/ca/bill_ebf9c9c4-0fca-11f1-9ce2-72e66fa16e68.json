Existing law prohibits contractors from performing specified acts. Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery or another state agency tasked to manage contracts for wildfire debris cleanup and removal by the Office of Emergency Services to prequalify contractors to enter into contracts to perform prescribed wildfire debris cleanup and removal work in communities impacted by wildfires.\n\nNotwithstanding the prequalification requirement, this bill would prohibit a contractor from engaging in debris removal in a declared disaster area, unless the contractor has one of specified license or classifications. During a declared federal, state, or local emergency or for a declared disaster area due to a natural disaster, the bill would require any licensee authorized to perform debris removal under these provisions to pass an approved hazardous substance certification examination and comply with hazardous waste operation and emergency response requirements, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
