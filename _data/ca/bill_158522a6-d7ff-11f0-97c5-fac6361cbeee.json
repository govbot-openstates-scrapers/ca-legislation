Existing law also authorizes the issuance of bonds in specified amounts pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law and requires that proceeds from the sale of these bonds be used to finance various existing housing programs, capital outlay related to infill development, brownfield cleanup that promotes infill development, and housing-related parks.\n\nThis bill would enact the Social Housing Bond Act of 2026 which, if approved by the voters, would authorize the issuance of bonds in the amount of $950,000,000 pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law, to fund social housing programs, as specified. The bill would create the California Housing Authority, which would be governed by the California Housing Authority Board, to ensure that social housing developments that are produced and acquired align with specified goals and would authorize the authority to issue the bonds and, upon appropriation of the Legislature, utilize funds from other sources to build more low, very low, and extremely low income housing. The bill would create the Social Housing Revolving Loan Fund to be used, upon appropriation of the Legislature, to provide zero-interest loan for the purpose of constructing housing to accommodate a mix of household incomes.\n\nThe bill would provide for the submission of the bond act to the voters at the November 3, 2026, statewide general election.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
