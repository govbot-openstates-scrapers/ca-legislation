Before a civil action alleging certain violations of the Labor Code by an aggrieved employee pursuant to PAGA commences, PAGA requires the aggrieved employee or representative to give written notice by online filing with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and by certified mail to the employer of the specific provisions of the Labor Code alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation, and requires that notice and any response to that notice by the employer to be accompanied by a filing fee of $75, as specified.\n\nThis bill would exempt a nonprofit organization exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the requirement to pay those filing fees."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
