Under existing law, the commission consists of 5 members appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Existing law authorizes the Governor to remove any member of the commission for cause, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the Governor to notify the Legislature of the removal of any member of the commission.\n\n(2) Existing law prohibits a corporation from being eligible for a state gambling license unless its officers, directors, and shareholders individually apply for and obtain a state gambling license. Existing law also requires every key employee to apply for and obtain a key employee license. Existing law requires an officer, director, or key employee of a corporate owner licensee to apply for a license within 30 calendar days after they become an officer, director, or key employee of the corporation and requires the corporation to immediately remove an officer or director who fails to apply for a license within that 30-day period.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
