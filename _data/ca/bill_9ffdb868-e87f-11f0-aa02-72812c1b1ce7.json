Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) , in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) and the Independent System Operator (ISO) , to take specified actions to facilitate the commercialization of microgrids for distribution customers of large electrical corporations.\n\nThis bill would require the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, in conjunction with the ISO, to identify six electrical infrastructure modernization zones, as provided. The bill would require the PUC and the Energy Commission to recognize these zones as load growth priority areas. The bill would authorize an electrical corporation that serves a customer within an electrical infrastructure modernization zone to work with the local jurisdiction to update its electrical load projections. The bill would require the PUC to authorize an electrical corporation that serves a customer within an electrical infrastructure modernization zone to expedite cost recovery and to manage microgrids, as specified.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the PUC is a crime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act, and because a violation of a PUC action implementing its requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the unincorporated area known as Altadena in the County of Los Angeles."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
