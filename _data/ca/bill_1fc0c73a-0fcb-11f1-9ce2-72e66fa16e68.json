Existing law also requires the chancellor's office, and requests the president's office, to, every 3 years after July 1, 2022, review and update the student housing plan, and include the specific actions to be taken in the next 5 fiscal years.\n\nThis bill would require the office of the Chancellor of the California State University and the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to establish an intersegmental student housing working group, composed of representatives from the 2 chancellor's offices, faculty, and students. The bill would request the office of the President of the University of California to join and appoint representatives to the working group. The bill would require the working group to use assessments of unmet demand developed by the respective segments in order to further analyze systemwide, regional, and campus-specific student housing needs. The bill would require the working group to develop a statewide plan that identifies opportunities for intersegmental collaboration to build campus housing and informs future state funding considerations."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
