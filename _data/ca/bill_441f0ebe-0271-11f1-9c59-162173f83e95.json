The bill would authorize the increase for a commercial disaster communication made on or after the date of a proclamation of a state of emergency or catastrophic disaster, as defined, until 60 calendar days after the termination of the state of emergency or catastrophic disaster, but prohibits the increase for applying more than 180 calendar days for any one state of emergency or catastrophic disaster.\n\nThe bill would make related findings and declarations."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Withdrawal of insurers."}, {"note": "", "title": "Advertising: false or misleading commercial disaster communication."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
