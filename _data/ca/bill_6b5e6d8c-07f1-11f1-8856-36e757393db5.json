Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or disability insurance policy to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders, as defined, under the same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions.\n\nExisting law establishes the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive medically necessary health care services, including specified mental health and substance use disorder services, pursuant to a schedule of benefits. \n\nExisting law provides for the regulation of community care facilities that provide nonmedical care, including residential facilities, short-term residential therapeutic programs, and group homes by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law requires the care and supervision provided by a short-term residential therapeutic program or group home to be nonmedical, except as otherwise permitted by law. \n\nThis bill would require the Department of Managed Health Care, the Department of Insurance, and the State Department of Health Care Services to prepare and send one letter to each chief financial officer of a health care service plan, health insurer, or Medi-Cal managed care plan that provides coverage, including out-of-network benefits, in California for substance use disorder in residential facilities, as defined. The bill would require the letter to include, among other things, a statement informing the plan or insurer that substance use disorder treatment in licensed or unlicensed residential facilities is almost exclusively nonmedical, with rare exceptions. The bill would authorize the Department of Managed Health Care, the Department of Insurance, and the State Department of Health Care Services to consult with each other, and would require those departments to consult with the State Department of Social Services, when preparing the contents of the letter. The bill would require the letters to be sent on or before October 1, 2026.\n\nThe bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2027."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
