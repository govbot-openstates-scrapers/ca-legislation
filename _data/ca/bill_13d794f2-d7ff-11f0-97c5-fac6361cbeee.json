Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) , State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) , and State Air Resources Board to issue a joint report to the Legislature by January 1, 2021, and every 4 years thereafter, that includes specified information relating to the implementation of that state policy.\n\nExisting law requires the PUC and the Energy Commission to undertake various actions in furtherance of meeting the state's clean energy and pollution reduction objectives.\n\nThis bill would require the Energy Commission, in coordination with specified agencies, to develop a strategic plan for new in-state geothermal energy in California, as specified. The bill would require the Energy Commission to submit the strategic plan to the Natural Resources Agency and the Legislature on or before June 30, 2027.\n\nThe bill would require the Energy Commission, in coordination with specified agencies, to work with stakeholders, other relevant federal, state, and local agencies, interested Native American tribes, California load-serving entities, and the geothermal energy industry to identify suitable and recommended locations for the development of new in-state geothermal energy, to establish state lands leasing goals for new in-state geothermal energy development for 2035 and 2045, as specified, and to identify opportunities to work with federal agencies on the timing, scope, and prioritization of geothermal lease sales to support geothermal development on federal lands within California, as specified. The bill would require the Energy Commission, in consultation with the PUC and the Independent System Operator (ISO) , to assess the transmission investments and upgrades necessary to support new in-state geothermal energy. The bill would require the PUC to designate new in-state geothermal energy as a long lead-time resource in its recurring input to the ISO's system need scoring for the interconnection and transmission planning process. The bill would require the Energy Commission, in coordination with specified entities, to develop and produce a permitting roadmap that describes timeframes and milestones for a coordinated, comprehensive, and efficient permitting process for new in-state geothermal energy exploration and field development and associated electricity and transmission infrastructure, as provided. The bill would require the Energy Commission, in coordination with the State Lands Commission, the Department of Conservation, and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, to assess the level at which new and existing geothermal rentals and royalties would best support California's long-term renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals while maintaining competitiveness with rentals and rates on federal lands and in other states, as provided. The bill would require the information described in this paragraph, an assessment of known impacts to Native American and Indigenous peoples and biological resources, and strategies for addressing those impacts, and an assessment, led by the Geologic Energy Management Division, using the best available data, of the in-state geothermal resource potential, to be included in the strategic plan, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Energy: new in-state geothermal energy generation."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
