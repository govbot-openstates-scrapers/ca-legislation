Existing law requires each state agency annually to review certain proprietary state lands over which it has jurisdiction to determine what land, if any, is in excess of its foreseeable needs and report this in writing to the department. Existing law, by January 1, 2024, requires the department to prepare and report to the Legislature a streamlined plan to transition underutilized multistory state buildings into housing for the purpose of expanding affordable housing development and adaptive reuse opportunities.\n\nThis bill, by January 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, would require the department to conduct an audit of utilization of state office buildings to determine opportunities to consolidate the square footage of office space given to a state agency, as provided. The bill would also authorize and require the department, in accordance with the findings of the above-described audit, to consolidate space within a state office building at the suite, floor, and building level. The bill would require any space made available by this consolidation to be reserved for use by the University of California, California State University, and the California Community Colleges. The bill would also make related findings and declarations."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Affordable housing."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
