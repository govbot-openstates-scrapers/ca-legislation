The act provides that a coastal development permit is not required for specified types of development in specified areas, as provided. \n\n This bill would authorize a city to designate itself as an urban multimodal community if the city has (1) at least one high-quality transit corridor or transit priority area in the city, (2) adopted plans that include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fatal and severe injury crashes, and (3) Class I, Class II, or Class IV bicycle facilities, as defined. If a city meets the criteria to designate itself as an urban multimodal community, the bill would require documentation be submitted to the Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation for review and would require the documentation to be posted on the city's internet website. The bill would provide that a coastal development permit is not required for certain activities and types of development within an urban multimodal community, as specified.\n\nThis bill would also provide that a coastal development permit is not required for the installation of Class I, Class II, or Class IV bicycle facilities, as defined, within the right-of-way of a state highway if the project does not eliminate existing public coastal accessways."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
