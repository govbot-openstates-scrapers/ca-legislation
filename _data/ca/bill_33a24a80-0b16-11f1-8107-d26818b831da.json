The bill would require the department to grant awards for the 2026\u201327 and 2027\u201328 fiscal years to eligible entities that are neighborhood partnerships or regional partnerships, as those terms are defined, to reduce child poverty and advance economic mobility for children and families disproportionately affected by intergenerational poverty. The bill would require the department, in consultation with the State Department of Education, to develop an application process and would require the department to establish performance standards to measure progress on indicators and results relevant to the evaluation of the grant program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
