Existing law defines \"direct contractor\" for this purpose to mean a contractor that has a direct contractual relationship with an owner.\n\nThis bill would apply the above-described provision to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2026. The bill would instead require, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2026, a direct contractor making or taking a contract in the state for the erection, construction, alteration, or repair of a building, structure, or other private work, to assume, and be liable for, any indebtedness for the performance of labor, as specified. The bill would prohibit a direct contractor from being held liable for the indebtedness with respect to fringe or other benefit contributions if they make contribution payments by joint check, as specified. The bill would define \"direct contractor\" for this purpose to mean a contractor that has a direct contractual relationship with an owner or any other person or entity engaging contractors or subcontractors, as specified, on behalf of the owner.\n\nExisting law provides for a streamlined, ministerial approval process or use by right for certain housing developments that meet specified requirements. Existing law requires these developments to meet specified labor standards, including, among other things, making health care expenditures for each employee, as specified. Existing law grants a joint labor-management cooperation committee standing to sue a construction contractor pursuant to the above-described liability provision for failure to make those health care expenditures.\n\nThis bill would additionally grant a joint labor-management cooperation committee standing to sue pursuant to the liability provision added by this bill."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
