Existing law authorizes the department to issue various types of temporary retail licenses and regulates the labeling of alcoholic beverages. Existing law prohibits a retailer from dispensing any draught beer upon which the proper tap sign or draught beer sign is not displayed or the manufacturer or bottler of which has not complied with laws relating to labeling and containers. \n\nThis bill would except licenses issued for the retail sale of beer on a temporary basis for special events from the prohibition on the dispensing of mislabeled draught beer, as described above. The bill would apply this prohibition to any licensee. The bill would specify that a licensee is prohibited from identifying one product and selling another to a consumer."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
