The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law requires the department to streamline and simplify existing Medi-Cal program procedures to improve access to lactation supports and breast pumps among Medi-Cal beneficiaries.\n\nThis bill would require the department to, by July 1, 2027, issue updated Medi-Cal guidance that clarifies Medi-Cal coverage for lactation services. The bill would also require the guidance to, among other things, clarify Medi-Cal coverage policies for a continuum of lactation services, including health education related to lactation, basic lactation support, and lactation consultation. The bill would require the department to seek stakeholder input on draft guidance prior to issuing the guidance. The bill would make the implementation of these provisions contingent to the extent that federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals are obtained."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
