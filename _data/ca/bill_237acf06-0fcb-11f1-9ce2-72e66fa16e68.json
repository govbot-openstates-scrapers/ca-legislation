The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, an initiative statute approved by the voters as Proposition 49 at the November 5, 2002, statewide general election, establishes the After School Education and Safety Program, under which participating public schools receive grants to operate before and after school programs serving pupils in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 9, inclusive. Existing federal law establishes the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program to provide pupils with academic enrichment and other activities during nonschool hours or periods when school is not in session, as provided.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact future legislation to reallocate existing state funding to increase access for unduplicated pupils to expanded learning programs for older pupils in grades 7 to 12, inclusive, aligned and coordinated with existing programs, including the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program, the After School Education and Safety Program, and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
