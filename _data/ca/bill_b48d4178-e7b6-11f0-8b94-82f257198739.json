{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB116", "title": "Health omnibus trailer bill.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Healthomnibustrailerbill"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities, including general acute care hospitals, acute psychiatric hospitals, and special hospitals, by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law requires the department to adopt regulations that establish minimum, specific, and numerical licensed nurse-to-patient ratios by licensed nurse classification and by hospital unit for all general acute care hospitals, acute psychiatric hospitals, and special hospitals. Existing law requires the regulations adopted by the department for acute psychiatric hospitals that are not operated by the State Department of State Hospitals to take into account the special needs of the patients served in the psychiatric units. Existing law generally makes a willful violation of those licensing provisions a crime.\n\nUnder existing law, on and after July 1, 2015, any acute psychiatric hospital that submits a completed application and is operated by the State Department of State Hospitals may be approved by the State Department of Public Health to offer, as a supplemental service, an Enhanced Treatment Program (ETP) that meets certain conditions, including sufficient and documented evaluation of violence risk of the patient. Existing law requires an ETP to meet certain requirements relating to staffing and patient room features and to implement certain policies and procedures on patient care.\n\nUnder existing law, those ETP provisions remain in effect for each pilot ETP until January 1 of the 5th calendar year after each pilot ETP site has admitted its first patient, and the provisions are repealed as of January 1 of the 5th calendar year after each pilot ETP site has admitted its first patient. Existing law requires the State Department of State Hospitals to post a declaration on its internet website regarding the timing of that repeal condition.\n\nThis bill would delete the above-described provisions regarding ETP repeal. The bill would instead repeal those provisions on January 1, 2030, as specified. To the extent that the bill would extend the operation of certain ETP sites, and by extending ETP requirements, the violation of which would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would specify regulations for acute psychiatric hospitals not operated by the State Department of State Hospitals are deemed to be an emergency and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, and general welfare, and would require the department to adopt emergency regulations for these facilities no later than January 31, 2026, and permanent regulations thereafter, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to readopt the emergency regulations, as specified. The bill would authorize the emergency regulations to include, among other things, staffing standards specific to acute psychiatric hospitals. \n\n(2) Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to use the direct care staffing level data it collects to determine whether a skilled nursing facility has met its nursing hours or direct care service hours per patient per day requirements, as specified. Existing law requires the department to assess specified administrative penalties on skilled nursing facilities that fail to meet these requirements and establishes an administrative process that skilled nursing facilities may use to appeal determinations or assessments made by the department. Existing law continues in the Special Deposit Fund the Skilled Nursing Facility Minimum Staffing Penalty Account and requires the administrative penalties described above to be deposited into that account. Under existing law, the account is continuously appropriated to the department to support the implementation of these provisions.\n\nThis bill would remove the Skilled Nursing Facility Minimum Staffing Penalty Account from the Special Deposit Fund. The bill would, notwithstanding any other law, authorize the State Controller to use the funds in the Skilled Nursing Facility Minimum Staffing Penalty Account for cash flow loans to the General Fund, as specified.\n\n(3) Existing law requires a clinic, health facility, home health agency, or hospice to prevent unlawful or unauthorized access to, and use or disclosure of, patients' medical information, as defined. Existing law requires the clinic, health facility, home health agency, or hospice to report any unlawful or unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, a patient's medical information to the State Department of Public Health and to the affected patient or the patient's representative, as specified. Existing law authorizes the department to assess administrative penalties for violation of these provisions and gives the department discretion to consider all factors when determining the amount of a penalty. Existing law requires these and other specified penalty moneys to be deposited into the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account, which is established within the Special Deposit Fund. Upon appropriation by the Legislature, existing law requires the moneys in the account to be expended for internal quality improvement activities in the Licensing and Certification Program.\n\nThis bill would remove the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account from the Special Deposit Fund and, notwithstanding specified provisions of law, require all interest earned on the moneys deposited in the account to be retained in the account. The bill would also, notwithstanding any other law, authorize the State Controller to use the funds in the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account for cash flow loans to the General Fund, as specified.\n\n(4) Existing law also establishes the Internal Health Information Integrity Quality Improvement Account. Existing law requires all administrative fines assessed by the State Department of Public Health for unlawful disclosures of confidential medical information, as specified, to be deposited in that account. Upon appropriation by the Legislature, existing law requires money in the account to be used for purposes of supporting quality improvement activities of the department.\n\nThe bill would, effective July 1, 2025, abolish the Internal Health Information Integrity Quality Improvement Account and transfer all moneys in the account to the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account. The bill would require all remaining balances, assets, liabilities, and encumbrances of the Internal Health Information Integrity Quality Improvement Account as of July 1, 2025, to be transferred to, and become part of, the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account. The bill would require the administrative fines assessed for unlawful disclosures of confidential medical information described above to be deposited in the Internal Departmental Quality Improvement Account. The bill would, upon appropriation by the Legislature, require money in the account to be used for purposes of supporting quality improvement activities of the Licensing and Certification Program. The bill would also, notwithstanding any other provision of law, authorize the State Controller to use the funds in the account for cash flow loans to the General Fund, as specified.\n\n(5) Existing law provides for the licensure of long-term health care facilities by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law establishes the State Health Facilities Citation Penalties Account and the Federal Health Facilities Citation Penalties Account in the Special Deposit Fund into which moneys from civil penalties for violations of state and federal law, respectively, are deposited. Existing law requires the moneys in those accounts to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, in accordance with state and federal law for the protection of health or property of residents of long-term health care facilities, as specified.\n\nThis bill would remove the State Health Facilities Citation Penalties Account and the Federal Health Facilities Citation Penalties Account from the Special Deposit Fund.\n\n(6) Existing law requires a skilled nursing facility, by January 1, 2026, to have an alternative source of power, as defined, to protect resident health and safety, as defined, for no fewer than 96 hours during any type of power outage. Existing law imposes specific compliance requirements based on whether a skilled nursing facility uses a generator as its alternative source of power, or batteries or a combination of batteries in tandem with a renewable electrical generation facility.\n\nThis bill would instead require a skilled nursing facility to comply with these provisions on or after January 1, 2026, commencing on the first day of the Medi-Cal skilled nursing facility rate year for which the State Department of Health Care Services publishes a written notice on its internet website that the Legislature has appropriated sufficient funds for the express purpose of providing an add-on to the Medi-Cal skilled nursing facility per diem rate for the projected Medi-Cal cost compliance, as specified. The bill would authorize the State Department of Health Care Services to implement these requirements by means of provider bulletins, policy letters, or other similar instructions, without taking regulatory action.\n\n(7) Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care, and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance.\n\nExisting law requires a pharmacy benefit manager under contract with a health care service plan to, among other things, register with the Department of Managed Health Care.\n\nThis bill would instead require a pharmacy benefit manager contracting with a health care service plan or health insurer to secure a license from the Department of Managed Health Care on or after January 1, 2027, or the date on which the department has established the licensure process, whichever is later. The bill would establish application requirements, and would require a pharmacy benefit manager applying for licensure to reimburse the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care for the actual cost of processing the application, including overhead, up to an amount not to exceed $25,000. The bill would require a pharmacy benefit manager to submit financial statements to the department at specified intervals, and would require those statements and other proprietary information to be kept confidential, as specified. The bill would authorize the director to suspend or revoke a pharmacy benefit manager license, but would provide that, once issued, a license remains in effect until revoked or suspended. The bill would authorize a pharmacy benefit manager whose license has been revoked, or suspended for more than one year to petition the director to reinstate the license, and would authorize the director to prescribe a fee, not to exceed $500, for the actual cost of processing the petition. The bill would create the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Fund in the State Treasury, into which fees, fines, penalties, and reimbursements collected from pharmacy benefit managers would be deposited, except fines and administrative penalties for specified acts or omissions would be deposited into the newly created Pharmacy Benefit Manager Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund in the State Treasury. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Health Care Access and Information to implement and administer the Health Care Payments Data System to learn about and seek to improve public health, population health, social determinants of health, and the health care system.\n\nThis bill would require a pharmacy benefit manager to provide specified data to the Department of Health Care Access and Information regarding drug pricing, fees, and other information. The bill would require a licensed health care service plan to pay an annual fee for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u201327 fiscal years for the reasonably necessary expenses of the Department of Health Care Access and Information to fund the Health Care Payments Data Program. The bill would also require a licensed pharmacy benefit manager to pay amounts twice per year to fund the actual and reasonably necessary expenses of the department to implement pharmacy benefit manager licensing and the actual and reasonably necessary expenses of the Department of Health Care Access and Information pertaining to data reporting by pharmacy benefit managers. The bill would require the Health Care Payments Data Program advisory committee to include pharmacy benefit managers.\n\n(8) Existing law requires large group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2025, to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility and fertility services, including a maximum of 3 completed oocyte retrievals with unlimited embryo transfers, as specified. Existing law also requires small group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2025, to offer coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility and fertility services.\n\nThis bill would instead require compliance with the above-described provisions by large and small group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026. The bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care and the Insurance Commissioner to issue guidance regarding these provisions until January 1, 2027, and would require the departments to consult with each other and stakeholders in issuing that guidance.\n\n(9) Existing law authorizes the State Public Health Officer, to the extent allowable under federal law, and upon the availability of funds, to expend moneys from the continuously appropriated AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Rebate Fund for a program to cover the costs of prescribed ADAP formulary medications for the prevention of HIV infection and other specified costs.\n\nExisting law authorizes the State Department of Public Health, to the extent that the activities are an allowable use of funds, to spend up to $23,000,000 from the ADAP Rebate Fund to implement certain programs, including an allocation of $5,000,000 annually for 3 years, beginning on July 1, 2024, to the Transgender, Gender Nonconforming, and Intersex (TGI) Wellness and Equity Fund to fund services related to care and treatment for eligible individuals living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nUnder existing law, expenditure from the ADAP Rebate Fund also includes an allocation of $5,000,000, in the 2024\u201325 fiscal year, available until June 30, 2027, to distribute funding to a community-based organization to make internal and external condoms available, if Senate Bill 954 of the 2023\u201324 Regular Session becomes effective, aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThis bill would additionally allow the moneys allocated to the TGI Wellness and Equity Fund to fund services related to HIV prevention, and would have the allocation begin instead on July 1, 2025. With regard to funding for condoms, the bill would remove the condition that Senate Bill 954 become effective, and would authorize the allocation until June, 30, 2028. This bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to spend up to $75,000,000 from the ADAP Rebate Fund to support current or eligible HIV services and programs, as specified. The bill would specify the allocation of those funds, including by authorizing up to $65,000,000 of that $75,000,000 to be spent to supplement or fund services, programs, or initiatives for which federal funding has been reduced or eliminated. By adding to the purposes of the ADAP Rebate Fund, and by extending the terms of certain allocations, the bill would make an appropriation. \n\n(10) Existing law requires the Office of Health Equity within the State Department of Public Health to administer the TGI Wellness and Equity Fund for purposes of funding grants to create programs, or funding existing programs, focused on coordinating trans-inclusive health care for individuals who identify as transgender, gender nonconforming, or intersex.\n\nThis bill would instead refer only to the State Department of Public Health, without specifying the office, for purposes of administering the fund.\n\nExisting law authorizes use of the moneys in the fund, upon appropriation, to fund grants for certain purposes, including grants to TGI-serving organizations for the purpose of facilitating therapeutic arts programs, such as dancing, painting, or writing.\n\nThis bill would restructure that specific purpose by having the grants be made available to TGI-serving organizations for facilitating evidence-based therapeutic arts programs. The bill would make conforming changes to related provisions.\n\n(11) Existing law, the California Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2020, requires the California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHSA) to enter into partnerships, in consultation with other state departments as necessary, to, among other things, increase patient access to affordable drugs. Existing law authorizes CHHSA to enter into partnerships regarding over-the-counter naloxone products to allow the development, manufacturing, or distribution of those products by an entity that is authorized to do so under federal or state law.\n\nThis bill, subject to an appropriation by the Legislature, would additionally authorize CHHSA to enter into partnerships to increase competition, lower prices, and address supply shortages for generic or brand name drugs to address emerging health concerns, for the development, production, procurement, or distribution of vaccines, as specified, and for the manufacture, purchase, or distribution of medical supplies or medical devices.\n\n(12) Existing law requires, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, that a jury determine whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time the offense was committed. Under existing law, if a defendant is found to be not guilty by reason of insanity, the court is required to commit the person to the State Department of State Hospitals or any other appropriate public or private treatment facility, as specified. If a defendant is confined in a state hospital or other treatment facility as an inpatient, existing law requires the medical director of the facility to submit a report, at 6-month intervals, to the court and the community program director of the county of commitment setting forth the status and progress of the defendant.\n\nThis bill would instead require the above-described report to be submitted every 12 months.\n\n(13) Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed by, and funded pursuant to, federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law sets forth a schedule of benefits under the Medi-Cal program, including prescribed drugs subject to the Medi-Cal list of contract drugs. \n\nExisting law requires a specified health care service plan contract, including a Medi-Cal managed care plan, to cover the costs for COVID-19 diagnostic and screening testing, as provided, regardless of whether the services are provided by an in-network or out-of-network provider. Existing law prohibits this coverage from being subject to copayment, coinsurance, deductible, or any other form of cost sharing. Existing law also prohibits a health care service plan from imposing prior authorization or any other utilization management requirements on COVID-19 diagnostic and screening testing. Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to seek any federal approval it deems necessary to implement those provisions regarding COVID-19.\n\nThis bill would require a Medi-Cal managed care plan, as defined, to cover COVID-19 screening, testing, immunizations, and therapeutics in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, all plan letters, the Medi-Cal provider manual, Medi-Cal managed care plan contracts with the department, as specified, and other guidance. The bill would exclude Medi-Cal managed care plans from the above-described prohibitions against cost sharing and utilization management by a health care service plan for COVID-19 diagnostic and screening testing. The bill would remove the above-described requirement on the State Department of Health Care Services to seek federal approval.\n\n(14) Existing law sets forth a schedule of benefits covered under the Medi-Cal program, including hospice service that is certified under the federal Medicare Program, subject to utilization controls. Under existing law, coverage is available only to the extent that no additional net program costs are incurred. Under existing law, prior authorization is not required for hospice services, with exceptions in the case of any admission that violates federal law or for inpatient hospice services.\n\nThis bill would make the above-described restriction on prior authorization inoperative on July 1, 2026, and would repeal it as of January 1, 2027. Under the bill, hospice services would be covered under Medi-Cal in accordance with Medicare requirements and subject to utilization controls, while maintaining the condition on net program costs. The bill would condition implementation of this coverage on the availability of federal financial participation and receipt of any necessary federal approvals.\n\n(15) Existing law authorizes the department to enter into contracts with manufacturers of single-source and multiple-source drugs, on a bid or nonbid basis, for drugs from each major therapeutic category. Existing law requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide to the department a state rebate equal to an amount not less than 10% of the average manufacturer price based on Medi-Cal utilization data for any drug products that have been added to the Medi-Cal list of contract drugs under provisions relating to treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or an AIDS-related condition or to treatment of cancer. Existing law authorizes the department to restrict the availability of the drug products of certain manufacturers by requiring prior authorization when the department has not received a timely rebate payment, but authorizes a beneficiary to continue obtaining those drugs if the beneficiary qualifies for continuing care status. Continuing care status requires a beneficiary to have been taking the drug at the time the manufacturer is placed on prior authorization status and the department to receive a claim for the drug with a date of service that is within 100 days prior to the date the manufacturer was placed on prior authorization status.\n\nThis bill would delete the above-described provisions on continuing care status and, instead, beginning January 1, 2026, would authorize beneficiaries to continue to receive drugs previously prescribed but subject to prior authorization if their pharmacy provider or prescriber initiates a prior authorization request that is subsequently approved by the department. This bill would, effective January 1, 2026, for pharmaceutical manufacturers renewing or entering new state rebate agreements, require that the rebate amount be in an amount not less than 20% of the average manufacturer price if the federal rebate is less than 50% of that price, or an amount not less than 15% of that price if the federal rebate is 50% or greater of that price.\n\nUnder existing law, for purposes of the above-described drug products, if the pharmaceutical manufacturer does not enter into a supplemental rebate agreement within 60 days after the addition of the drug to the Medi-Cal list of contract drugs, the manufacturer is required to provide to the department a state rebate equal to not less than 20% of the average manufacturer price, as specified.\n\nThis bill would increase the state rebate minimum threshold to not less than 25% of the price. The bill would make a conforming change to a related provision.\n\nExisting law establishes the Medi-Cal Drug Rebate Fund, into which nonfederal moneys collected by the department under the above-described rebate provisions are deposited. Under existing law, funds deposited into the Medi-Cal Drug Rebate Fund are continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of funding the nonfederal share of health care services for children, adults, seniors, and persons with disabilities enrolled in the Medi-Cal program.\n\nBy increasing the state rebate minimum threshold for the above-described drug products, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\nExisting law requires the department, when it determines that a drug should be removed from the list of contract drugs, to conduct a public hearing to receive comment on the impact of removing the drug.\n\nThis bill would, instead of a public hearing, require the department to provide individual notice to impacted beneficiaries that the drug is only obtainable through the prior authorization process. The bill would require that the notice include a description of the beneficiary's right to a fair hearing and would encourage the beneficiary to consult a physician. The bill would require the department to also provide provider notice about the removal of the drug, as specified. \n\n(16) Existing law requires, with exceptions, the temporary placement of a Medi-Cal provider under payment suspension upon receipt of a credible allegation of fraud for which an investigation is pending under the Medi-Cal program against the provider. Existing law sets forth related provisions regarding the department's collection of overpayments, appeal procedures afforded to the provider, offsetting of the overpayments to satisfy audit or appeal findings if the findings are against the provider, and return of the overpayments if the findings are in favor of the provider, as specified. Existing law authorizes the lifting of a payment suspension upon resolution of an investigation for fraud or abuse.\n\nThis bill would create the Medi-Cal Anti-Fraud Special Deposit Fund for the deposit of outstanding Medi-Cal payments intercepted as a result of a payment suspension. Under the bill, moneys would be continuously appropriated and allocated, but would remain in the fund until the department lifts the suspension, after which the department would be authorized to return the intercepted Medi-Cal payments to the provider or to offset the payments against any liabilities or restitution owed by the provider to the department.\n\n(17) Existing law, the Medi-Cal Long-Term Care Reimbursement Act, requires the department to implement a facility-specific ratesetting system for certain skilled nursing facilities using a cost-based reimbursement rate methodology. Existing law requires the department, subject to any necessary federal approvals, for managed care rating periods that begin between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2026, inclusive, to establish and implement the Workforce and Quality Incentive Program. Under that program, a network provider furnishing skilled nursing facility services to a Medi-Cal managed care enrollee is authorized to earn performance-based directed payments from the Medi-Cal managed care plan with which they contract, as specified, in addition to other certain payments. Existing law repeals the act on January 1, 2028, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead apply the program to managed care rating periods that begin between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2025, inclusive. The bill would make the provisions relating to the program inoperative on January 1, 2026, and authorize the department to conduct all necessary closeout activities applicable to any managed care rating period before January 1, 2026. The bill would repeal those provisions on January 1, 2027, or on the date that the Director of Health Care Services certifies to the Secretary of State that all necessary closeout activities have been completed, whichever is later, but no later than January 1, 2028. The bill would delete a related provision regarding the supplementation of funds available for payments made under the program, as described above, for the 2026 calendar year.\n\n(18) Existing law, subject to an appropriation by the Legislature for this purpose, expands the schedule of benefits to include an annual cognitive health assessment for Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are 65 years of age or older if they are otherwise ineligible for a similar assessment as part of an annual wellness visit under the Medicare Program. Existing law makes a Medi-Cal provider eligible to receive the payment for this benefit only if they comply with certain requirements, including completing cognitive health assessment training, as specified. Existing law requires the department, by January 1, 2024, and every 2 years thereafter, to consolidate and analyze data related to the benefit, and to post information on the utilization of, and payment for, the benefit on its internet website.\n\nThis bill would delete the requirement that a Medi-Cal provider complete specified cognitive health assessment training to be eligible to receive the payment. The bill would also delete the requirement that the department consolidate and analyze data and post information related to the benefit every 2 years.\n\n(19) Existing law authorizes the Director of Health Care Services to terminate a contract or impose sanctions if the director finds that an entity that contracts with the department for the delivery of health care services, known as a contractor, fails to comply with contract requirements, state or federal law or regulations, or the state plan or approved waivers, or for other good cause. Existing law includes various entities as part of the definition of \"contractor\" for purposes of these provisions, including Medi-Cal managed care plans and Drug Medi-Cal organized delivery systems.\n\nThis bill would add, to the list of contractors subject to the above-described provisions, entities under the Home- and Community-Based Alternatives (HCBA) Waiver and the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) , as specified.\n\n(20) Under existing law, to the extent that federal financial participation is available, federally qualified health center (FQHC) services and rural health clinic (RHC) services are covered Medi-Cal benefits. Under existing law, FQHC and RHC services are reimbursed on a per-visit basis, as defined.\n\nThis bill would, commencing July 1, 2026, require reimbursement for FQHC and RHC services that are eligible for federal financial participation. The bill would revise the definition of visit for purposes of this provision to mean a face-to-face encounter between an FQHC or RHC patient and specified health professionals that is eligible for federal financial participation or an encounter between an FQHC or RHC patient and specified health professionals using specified modalities, including, among others, video synchronous interaction, when services delivered through those modalities meet the applicable standard of care and are eligible for federal participation.\n\n(21) Existing law requires the department to establish the Nondesignated Public Hospital Intergovernmental Transfer Program to provide supplemental payments to nondesignated public hospitals in a manner that maximizes federal financial participation in the resulting supplemental payments. Existing law authorizes a transferring entity, as defined, to agree to transfer its intergovernmental transfer (IGT) allocation, as defined, to the state in accordance with the program, and requires the state to deposit the transferred funds into the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund, which is a continuously appropriated fund. Existing law authorizes the state to retain 9% of each intergovernmental transfer amount to reimburse the department, or transfer to the General Fund, for the administrative costs of operating the program and for the benefit of Medi-Cal children's health care programs.\n\nThis bill would require a nondesignated public hospital participating in the program to reimburse the department for specified administrative costs as a condition of receiving the above-described supplemental payments. Beginning with the 2026\u201327 fiscal year and every fiscal year thereafter, the bill would require the state to retain a percentage of each IGT amount associated with interim supplemental payments such that the total amount retained is equal to the projected administrative cost to the department, as specified. The bill would require the department to project the specified administrative costs each fiscal year to determine the percentage to be retained. To the extent the bill would continuously appropriate additional moneys, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(22) Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal Hospital/Uninsured Care Demonstration Project Act, which revises hospital reimbursement methodologies under the Medi-Cal program to maximize the use of federal funds consistent with federal Medicaid law and stabilize the distribution of funding for hospitals that provide care to Medi-Cal beneficiaries and uninsured patients. Existing law provides funding, in supplementation of Medi-Cal reimbursement, to various hospitals, including nondesignated public hospitals, in accordance with certain provisions relating to disproportionate share hospitals. Existing law establishes the Nondesignated Public Hospital Supplemental Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, in the State Treasury, and requires all amounts in the fund for a project year in excess of the amount necessary to make specified supplemental payments to be available for negotiation by the California Medical Assistance Commission, as provided.\n\nFor the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, this bill would require additional supplemental payments to be made to nondesignated public hospitals that meet certain criteria such that the specified payments made are equal to the prescribed amount transferred from the General Fund plus the applicable amount of federal financial participation that is available for the nonfederal share of payments. The bill would require the remaining amounts in the fund to be used for supplemental payments to nondesignated public hospitals pursuant to a methodology developed by the department, as specified. The bill would make these provisions inoperative on June 30, 2026, abolish the fund effective December 31, 2028, and repeal these provisions on July 1, 2030. The bill would authorize the department to conduct any necessary and remaining duties, as specified, even after these provisions become inoperative. \n\n(23) The federal Medicaid program prohibits payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law. Existing state law extends Medi-Cal eligibility for the full scope of Medi-Cal benefits to an individual who does not have satisfactory immigration status if they are otherwise eligible for those benefits, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead exclude an individual who is 19 years of age or older and does not have satisfactory immigration status from dental benefits under Medi-Cal, as specified and would, beginning no sooner than July 1, 2027, require individuals who are not pregnant and who are 19 to 59 years of age, inclusive, to pay a monthly premium of $30, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would make an individual who is 19 years of age or older and does not have satisfactory immigration status and who applies for Medi-Cal on or after January 1, 2026, eligible only for pregnancy-related services and emergency medical treatment. The bill would delay the implementation of certain provisions until the director makes specified communications to the Department of Finance. The bill would make other conforming changes. Because counties are required to make Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and this bill would alter Medi-Cal eligibility, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(24) Existing law prohibits the use of an assets or resources test for individuals whose income eligibility for Medi-Cal is determined based on the application of a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) . Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a non-MAGI standard for determining the eligibility of certain populations.\n\nExisting law, subject to receipt of any necessary federal approvals, prohibits the use of resources, including property or other assets, to determine Medi-Cal eligibility for applicants or beneficiaries whose eligibility is not determined using the MAGI-based financial methods. Existing law requires the department to seek federal authority to disregard all resources as authorized by the flexibilities provided pursuant to federal law.\n\nThis bill would, commencing on January 1, 2026, remove the above-described prohibition on the use of resources for determining Medi-Cal eligibility in non-MAGI cases and implement a disregard of $130,000 in nonexempt property for a case with one member and $65,000 for each additional household member, up to a maximum of 10 members, as specified. As part of conforming changes, the bill would make certain provisions inoperative on January 1, 2026, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2027. The bill would make certain inoperative provisions operative for purposes of reinstating references to resources or assets.\n\nThe bill would make certain additional changes to the above-described provisions, including modifying the timeline of certain regulations and changing certain reporting requirements.\n\nBy creating new duties for counties relating to the consideration of resources for determining Medi-Cal eligibility, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(25) Existing law establishes the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, administered by the California Health and Human Services Agency and its departments, with the purpose of transforming the state's behavioral health system into an innovative ecosystem in which all children and youth 25 years of age and younger, regardless of payer, are screened, supported, and served for emerging and existing behavioral health needs. Existing law requires, subject to an appropriation, that the initiative include, among other things, grants to qualified entities to support implementation of the initiative for behavioral health services in schools and investments for behavioral health workforce, education, and training. Existing law authorizes the Department of Health Care Access and Information to award competitive grants to qualified entities and individuals to expand the supply of behavioral health counselors, coaches, peer supports, and other allied health care providers serving children and youth, including those at schoolsites.\n\nExisting law defines a \"behavioral health coach,\" for purposes of those provisions, to mean a new category of behavioral health provider who, among other things, (A) is trained specifically to help address the unmet mental health and substance use needs of children and youth, (B) receives appropriate supervision from licensed staff, and (C) has training and qualifications, including psychoeducation, system navigation, crisis deescalation, safety planning, coping skills, and motivational interviewing.\n\nThis bill would revise these provisions to replace the term \"behavioral health coach\" with \"certified wellness coach.\" The bill would specify that a certified wellness coach receives appropriate supervision and coordination from staff who are licensed or who hold a pupil personnel services credential or school nurse services credential. The bill would add crisis referral to, and remove crisis deescalation and safety planning from, the list of a certified wellness coach's training and qualifications.\n\n(26) Existing law, as a component of the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, authorizes the State Department of Health Care Services to award competitive grants to entities that it deems qualified to, among other things, expand access to licensed medical and behavioral health professionals, counselors, peer support specialists, community health workers, and behavioral health coaches serving children and youth.\n\nThis bill would revise that provision to replace the term \"behavioral health coaches\" with \"certified wellness coaches.\"\n\n(27) Existing law establishes a Department of Health Care Access and Information within the California Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nExisting law requires the department, on or before July 1, 2023, to develop and approve statewide requirements for community health worker certificate programs and to approve the curriculum required for programs to certify community health workers. Existing law requires the department, on or before July 1, 2023, to review, approve, or renew evidence-based curricula and community-defined curricula for core competencies, specialized programs, and training. Existing law requires an organization that seeks approval or renewal of a community health worker certificate program to submit a community health worker certificate program plan, submit to periodic reviews, and submit annual community health worker certificate program reports, as specified. Existing law authorizes the department, in consultation with stakeholders, to request that an individual who is either enrolled in, or who has completed, a community health worker certificate program submit specified workforce data. Existing law defines \"community health worker\" to, among other things, include nonlicensed health workers with the qualifications developed pursuant to these provisions.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions. The bill would make conforming changes to provisions defining \"community health worker\" by cross-reference to the above-described definition.\n\n(28) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(29) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\n(30) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
