The bill would prescribe the information that constitutes proof of lawful possession, as specified, including the identity of the seller and the date of the transaction. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would also prohibit a person from falsifying any record intending to show proof of lawful possession. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law prohibits any collector or dealer of metals to purchase certain junk metals, as specified, without first ascertaining that the seller legally possesses the materials. Existing law also requires the dealer to obtain evidence of the identity of the seller, including, but not limited to, the seller's name and address.\n\nThis bill would require any collector or dealer of metals to ascertain the location from which the purchased material was obtained.\n\nExisting law makes it a crime for a person who is engaged in the salvage, recycling, purchase, or sale of scrap metal to possess certain items that have been stolen or obtained by theft or extortion, as specified, and requires that the person knew or reasonably should have known that the property was stolen or failed to report possession of the items, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally prohibit a person who is engaged in the salvage, recycling, purchase, or sale of scrap metal, as specified, from possessing certain items knowing that those items were possessed without proof of lawful possession.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
