The Constitution requires the Legislature to include that revenue estimate in the budget bill.\n\nThe Constitution also requires the Legislature to pass a budget bill by midnight on June 15 of each year. If that deadline is not met, the Members of the Legislature forfeit any salary or reimbursement for travel or living expenses from midnight on June 15 until the day that the budget bill is presented to the Governor.\n\nThis measure would authorize the Controller, no later than 30 days after the date of the budget bill's passage, to determine that the budget bill violates the balanced budget provision.
