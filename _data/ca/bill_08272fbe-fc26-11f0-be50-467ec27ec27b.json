That prior law created an industry panel consisting of 10 members, as specified, within the agency to inform the stakeholder process. That prior law authorized the California Workforce Development Board to contract the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Labor Center to facilitate implementation and authorized the UCLA Labor Center to commission expert research and testimony to supplement the stakeholder process. That prior law required the industry panel to provide an annual update on the stakeholder process at a regularly scheduled meeting of the California Workforce Development Board. That prior law required the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the California Workforce Development Board, upon the completion of the stakeholder process, but not later than July 1, 2023, to issue findings and recommendations on the most effective ways to implement policies and programs to mitigate the employment impacts of automation and the transitioning of seaport operations to low- and zero-emission operations on workers and individuals living in communities adjacent to the ports.\n\nThis bill would reinstate the above-described provisions until January 1, 2029, to determine how to best mitigate national security, cybersecurity, workforce, and economic impacts of automation at California seaports. The bill would instead create an industry panel consisting of 17 members, as specified. The bill would require the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the California Workforce Development Board, upon the completion of the stakeholder process, but not later than July 1, 2027, to issue findings and recommendations, as described above. The bill would condition the implementation of these provisions on an appropriation by the Legislature for this express purpose."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
