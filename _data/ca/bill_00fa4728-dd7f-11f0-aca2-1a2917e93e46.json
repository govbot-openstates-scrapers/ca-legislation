CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nThis bill would exempt from the requirements of CEQA a project developed solely to serve an urgent public health or housing need, as specified, that is within the boundaries of an expired regional habitat conservation plan, and that had an environmental review completed consistent with the requirements of the regional habitat conservation plan as the plan existed before the plan's expiration. Because the bill would require a lead agency to determine the applicability of this exemption, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Environmental Quality Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
