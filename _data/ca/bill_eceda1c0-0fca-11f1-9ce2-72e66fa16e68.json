Existing law requires the commission to establish a surcharge to fund low-income assistance programs and cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation activities and public interest research and development not adequately provided by the competitive and regulated markets, as specified. Existing law requires the State Board of Equalization to transmit revenues from that surcharge to the Treasurer, and requires the Treasurer to deposit those revenues into the Gas Consumption Surcharge Fund, which is continuously appropriated.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that requirement on the Treasurer."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
