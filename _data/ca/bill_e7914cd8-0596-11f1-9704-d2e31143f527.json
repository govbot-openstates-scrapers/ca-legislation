{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1113", "title": "Federally qualified health centers: mission spend ratio.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Federallyqualifiedhealthcenters", "missionspendratio"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including federally qualified health center (FQHC) services as described by federal law. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nThis bill would require each FQHC to have an annual mission spend ratio, as defined, of no less than 90% and would provide a methodology for calculation of that ratio, as specified, until the State Department of Public Health (department) has adopted a methodology for this purpose, with a goal of implementation of the latter methodology by January 1, 2028.\n\nBy June 30, 2027, and annually thereafter by June 30, the bill would require each FQHC or its parent corporation to report to the department total revenues collected in a form to be determined by the department. The bill would require each report to include, among other things, one of certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms. The bill would require each FQHC to submit an annual registration fee in an amount to be determined by the department and adjusted as necessary to fund these provisions. The bill would require the department to calculate and prepare a report of each FQHC's mission spend ratio no later than 90 days after the deadline for receipt of each FQHC's submission. The bill would require the department to conduct an audit of the financial information reported by FQHCs every 3 years, as specified.\n\nThis bill would impose penalties for failure of an FQHC to comply with the above-described reporting and mission spend ratio requirements, including an administrative fine of $5,000 for a first violation and $10,000 for each subsequent month that an FQHC fails to submit an annual report. The bill would require those penalties to be deposited into the Mission Spend Ratio Penalty Account, which would be subject to appropriation by the Legislature, within the Special Deposit Fund.\n\nThis bill would require an FQHC to abate the violation within 2 years after the department imposes an administrative penalty. The bill would prohibit the FQHC from being required to pay the penalty if it meets specified requirements within the abatement period, including reaching an agreement with the department on a plan to spend the total amount of the administrative penalty on mission-directed expenses within 2 years. The bill would require the department to conduct annual audits of any FQHC that has reached an agreement with the department. If the department determines that an FQHC is not in substantial compliance with the agreed-upon plan, the bill would require the FQHC to pay the imposed administrative penalty within 2 working days and to pay other costs, as specified. The bill would provide that appeals run concurrently with the abatement period.\n\nThis bill would authorize an FQHC to apply to the department for a waiver providing a temporary pause of the above-described reporting and mission spend ratio requirements or for an alternative mission spend ratio requirement on the basis of unexpected or exceptional circumstances or the FQHC's economic condition. The bill would provide that a waiver or alternative mission spend ratio is for a term of one calendar year. The bill would prescribe various types of information to be reported by an FQHC to obtain a waiver or alternative mission spend ratio. The bill would authorize the department to provide an alternative mission spend ratio to an FQHC to adjust, exclude, or otherwise account for imminently planned capital improvement, as specified, if the assessed penalty will result in the inability for the planned capital improvement to move forward during the next calendar year. The bill would authorize an FQHC to apply to renew a waiver or alternative mission spend ratio at any time no fewer than 180 days before the expiration of the existing waiver or alternative mission spend ratio.\n\nThis bill would make its provisions inapplicable to an FQHC or FQHC look-alike that is owned or operated by a political subdivision of the state or by a tribe or tribal organization or urban Indian organization receiving certain federal funding, as specified, or to an FQHC or FQHC look-alike participating in a bona fide labor-management cooperation committee.\n\nThe bill would require the department to adopt all regulations necessary to implement these provisions and would authorize the department to implement, interpret, or make specific these provisions, in whole or in part, by means of information notices, all-county letters, or other similar instructions without taking regulatory action. The bill would make its provisions severable. The bill would define various terms for purposes of these provisions."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health emergencies."}, {"note": "", "title": "Federally qualified health centers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
