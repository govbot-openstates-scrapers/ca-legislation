Existing law prescribes certain minimum standards for a person to be appointed as a peace officer, including moral character and physical and mental condition, and certain disqualifying factors for a person to be employed as a peace officer, including a felony conviction.\n\nThis bill would require a law enforcement agency that employs a peace officer to have a policy prohibiting that officer from carrying any firearm when the officer has a blood alcohol concentration greater than 0.00%, whether the officer is on duty or off duty, unless the officer is on duty and engaged in an undercover assignment in the course of their employment as a peace officer. By imposing new duties on local law enforcement, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
