Existing law requires the governing board or body of a school district, county office of education, or charter school to perform specified actions relating to pupils and immigration status, including, among others, providing information to parents and guardians, as appropriate, regarding their children's right to a free public education, regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs.\n\nThis bill would require the governing board or body of a local educational agency to post specified information related to immigration enforcement in the administrative buildings and on the internet websites of the local educational agency and each of its schoolsites, as provided. To the extent the bill imposes additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 234.7 of the Education Code proposed by AB 49 to be operative only if this bill and AB 49 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
