Existing law requires that a local agency that maintains public email addresses to ensure that each email address provided to its employees uses a \".gov\" domain name or a \".ca.gov\" domain name no later than January 1, 2029. Existing law defines \"local agency\" for these purposes as a city, county, or city and county.\n\nThis bill would recast these provisions by instead requiring a city, county, or city and county to comply with the above-described domain requirements and by deleting the term \"local agency\" from the above-described provisions. The bill would also require a special district, joint powers authority, or other political subdivision to comply with similar domain requirements no later than January 1, 2031. The bill would allow a community college district or community college to use a \".edu\" domain to satisfy these requirements, and would specify that these requirements do not apply to a K\u201312 public school district. By adding to the duties of local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
