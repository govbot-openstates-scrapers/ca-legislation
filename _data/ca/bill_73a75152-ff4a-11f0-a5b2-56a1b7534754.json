Existing law requires the commission to require electrical corporations and gas corporations to perform home weatherization services, as described, for low-income customers if the commission determines that a significant need for those services exists in the corporation's service territory, taking into consideration both the cost-effectiveness of the services and the policy of reducing the hardships facing low-income households, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to require electrical corporations and gas corporations, in performing home weatherization services, to prioritize household affordability, integration of electrification and health and safety measures, and coordinated delivery across fuel types and housing conditions, while preserving flexibility in program design.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
