Existing law provides that the certification issued by the commission is in lieu of any permit, certificate, or similar document required by a state, local, or regional agency for the use of the site and related facility.\n\nThis bill would exclude energy storage facilities that use batteries as a storage medium from the above-described provisions.\n\nThis bill would prohibit, until January 1, 2028, a public agency from authorizing the construction of a battery energy storage facility, as defined. The bill would require the State Fire Marshal, on or before January 1, 2028, to adopt guidelines and minimum standards for the construction of a battery energy storage facility to prevent fires and protect nearby communities from any fire hazard posed by the facility. The bill would require a public agency, when authorizing the construction of a battery energy storage facility on or after January 1, 2028, to require the facility to meet the guidelines and minimum standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal or more stringent guidelines and minimum standards as determined appropriate by the public agency.\n\nBecause the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies in authorizing the construction of a battery energy storage facility, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Construction and safety standards: battery storage facilities."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
