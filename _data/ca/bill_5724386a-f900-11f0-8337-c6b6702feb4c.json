These graduation requirements include, among others, the completion of 3 courses in social studies, including a one-semester course in American government and civics.\n\nExisting law establishes the Instructional Quality Commission and requires the commission to, among other things, recommend curriculum frameworks to the State Board of Education.\n\nThis bill, subject to appropriation by the Legislature for this purpose, would require the State Department of Education, in collaboration with, and subject to the approval of, the executive director of the state board, to enter into a contract with a county office of education or a consortium of county offices of education for the purpose of developing a curriculum guide for a one-year course in American government and civics, as provided. The bill would require the curriculum guide to include, among other things, fundamentals on federal, state, and local government, as provided, and specified information relating to voting.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or before January 1, 2020, to recommend to the state board criteria for awarding a State Seal of Civic Engagement to pupils who have demonstrated excellence in civics education and participation and have demonstrated an understanding of the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and the democratic system of government. Existing law requires the state board, on or before January 31, 2021, to adopt, reject, or modify the criteria recommended by the Superintendent.\n\nThis bill would provide that a pupil's successful completion of a one-year course in American government and civics satisfies specified criteria adopted by the state board related to the State Seal of Civic Engagement. The bill would require a pupil who has successfully completed a one-year course in American government and civics, in order to receive the State Seal of Civic Engagement, to still satisfy all other criteria adopted by the state board."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "High school graduation requirements: American government and civics: curriculum guide: State Seal of Civic Engagement."}, {"note": "", "title": "High school graduation requirements: American government and civics: model curriculum: State Seal of Civic Engagement."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
