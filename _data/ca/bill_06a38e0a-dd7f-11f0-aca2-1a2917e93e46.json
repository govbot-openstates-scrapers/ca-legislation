Existing law provides that participation in the registry is voluntary and open to any entity conducting business in the state. Existing law authorizes the agency to enter into a contract with a qualified nonprofit organization to do specified things, including to recruit broad participation in the registry from all economic sectors and regions of the state. Existing law limits the term of the term of the contract to 3 years, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead require the agency to oversee the administration of the above-described registry and would authorize the agency to enter into a new contract, limited to a term of 3 years and with a total budget of $2,000,000, to do specified things, including to recruit broad participation in the registry from all economic sectors and regions of the state to meet the different needs of water users throughout the state by various means, as provided.
