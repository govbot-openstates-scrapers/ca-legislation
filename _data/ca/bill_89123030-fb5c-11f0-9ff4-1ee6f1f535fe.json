Existing law provides for the regulation of disability and health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law sets forth specified coverage requirements for plan contracts and insurance policies.\n\nThis bill, the Obesity Prevention Treatment Parity Act, would require an individual or group health care service plan contract or health insurance policy that provides coverage for outpatient prescription drug benefits, as specified, and is issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, to include coverage for at least one specified anti-obesity medication and intensive behavioral therapy for the treatment of obesity without prior authorization. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
