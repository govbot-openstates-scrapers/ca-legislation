Existing law also prohibits specified local agency officers or employees from engaging in any employment, activity, or enterprise for compensation that is inconsistent, incompatible, or in conflict with, or inimical to, their duties, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a public officer or employee from issuing a meme coin. The bill would define certain terms for purposes of this prohibition, including defining public officer to include a state or local elected or appointed officer, including a Member of the Legislature, or an elected or appointed member of a governmental board, commission, committee, or other body, including a governmental body that has only advisory powers.
