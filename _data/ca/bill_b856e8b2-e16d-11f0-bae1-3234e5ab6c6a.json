Existing law generally makes a violation of the act a misdemeanor and grounds for suspension or revocation of a license, except as specified. Existing law, until January 1, 2027, requires an applicant for a new permanent on-sale general public premises (Type 48) license and the holder of an existing Type 48 license to offer drug testing devices and drink lids to their customers and to post a related notice, as specified. Existing law also requires those applicants and licensees to contact and provide specified information to law enforcement or emergency medical services when they are notified by a customer that the customer or another customer believes they have been a victim of drink spiking, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, commencing July 1, 2026, until January 1, 2029, require any person who obtains a catering authorization or daily on-sale license for the sale of alcoholic beverages at a large outdoor event, as defined, to comply with the above-described drink spiking requirements. The bill would require a licensee to comply with all manufacturer instructions relating to testing devices, as specified, and would specify that a licensee who complies with the manufacturer's instructions shall not be held liable for a defective test or inaccurate test result. The bill would specify that a violation of its provisions is not a crime and would specify that a first violation would result only in a warning by the department."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Conservation: San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission: legislative findings."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
