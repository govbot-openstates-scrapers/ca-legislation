A willful violation of any provision of the act constitutes a crime, as specified. The act requires a trust account to be placed in a non-interest-bearing account in a federally insured depository institution, a federal home loan bank, or other similar government-sponsored enterprise, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a financial institution, as defined, to deposit hazard insurance proceeds in an interest-bearing account in a federally insured depository institution, a federal home loan bank, a federal reserve bank, or another similar government-sponsored enterprise.\n\nExisting law requires a financial institution that makes loans upon the security of real property containing only a one- to four-family residence in this state or purchases obligations secured by the property and that receives money in advance for payment of taxes and assessments on the property, for insurance, or for other purposes relating to the property to pay interest on those amounts to the borrower, as specified. Existing law prohibits those financial institutions from imposing any fee or charge in connection with the maintenance or disbursement of money received in advance for the payment of taxes and assessments on real property securing loans made by the financial institution, or for the payment of insurance, or for other purposes relating to that real property, which would result in an interest rate of less than 2% per annum being paid on the moneys received. Existing law defines the term financial institution for purposes of those provisions to include, among other things, savings associations.\n\nThis bill would require a financial institution that makes loans or purchases obligations as described above and that holds hazard insurance proceeds in a loss draft account pending property rebuilding or repair to pay interest on those funds at a rate of at least 2% simple interest per annum, except as specified. The bill would require that interest to start accruing on the effective date of the bill, as specified. The bill would prohibit those financial institutions from imposing any fee or charge in connection with the maintenance or disbursement of hazard insurance proceeds held in a loss draft account pending rebuilding or repair of the real property that would result in an interest rate of less than 2% per annum being paid on the amounts held. The bill would specify that the above provisions do not apply to hazard insurance proceeds held in a loss draft account that are required by a state or federal regulatory authority to be placed by a financial institution other than a bank in a non-interest-bearing demand trust fund account of a bank.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property insurance notice of cancellation."}, {"note": "", "title": "Property insurance: notice of cancellation."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
