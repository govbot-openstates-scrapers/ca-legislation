{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB123", "title": "Higher education budget trailer bill.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Highereducationbudgettrailerbill"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law establishes the Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program to provide one-time grants for the construction of student housing, or for the acquisition and renovation of commercial properties into student housing for the purpose of providing affordable, low-cost housing options for students enrolled in public postsecondary education in the state. Existing law requires the University of California to fund project grants using revenue bond funding issued by the University of California for certain projects.\n\nThis bill would require the University of California to fund construction grants for 2 specified student housing projects using revenue bond funding issued by the University of California.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the California Kids Investment and Development Savings (KIDS) Program, under the administration of the Scholarshare Investment Board, for the purposes of expanding access to higher education through savings, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the governing body of a school district, county office of education, or charter school to confirm that a grade 12 pupil who has not opted out, as specified, completes and submits a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or, if the pupil is exempt from paying nonresident tuition under existing law, completes and submits a form for purposes of the California Dream Act, as provided.\n\nCommencing with the 2025\u201326 school year, this bill would require the governing body of a local educational agency to provide each pupil and the pupil's parent or legal guardian with information about the KIDS Program and the pupil's potential eligibility for that benefit, as provided. By imposing new duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law, for the 2023\u201324 and 2024\u201325 fiscal years, requires the Scholarshare Investment Board to partner with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Riverside County Office of Education to explore ways to increase participation in the KIDS Program.

The bill would require the board, on or before September 30, 2029, in collaboration with those local educational agencies, to submit an additional report with the same information related to those partnerships to the Department of Finance and the Legislature.\n\n(3) Existing law requires the California State University, and requests the University of California, to establish a model uniform set of academic standards for high school courses for admission recognition, as specified, and to develop and implement, by January 1, 2006, a process for high schools to obtain approval of their courses meeting California State University and University of California admissions requirements, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead require the California State University, and request the University of California, to begin working on establishing the above-described model uniform set of academic standards on or after October 1, 2025, and would require the model uniform set of academic standards to also be established for college-level coursework taken for credit at a California public college or university by a pupil simultaneously enrolled in high school, as provided. The bill would require the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to post on its internet website the model uniform set of academic standards for college-level coursework taken for credit at a California public college or university, as provided.\n\n(4) The Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement Awards, the California Community College Expanded Entitlement Awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement Awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B Awards, the Cal Grant C Awards, and the Cal Grant T Awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.\n\nUnder existing law, an otherwise qualifying institution with a 3-year cohort default rate that is equal to or greater than 15.5% is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards at the institution, as specified, with certain exceptions. Existing law requires the commission to certify by November 1 of each year a qualifying institution's latest 3-year cohort default rate and graduation rate as most recently reported by the United States Department of Education, except for the 2024\u201325 academic year existing law requires the commission to use the 3-year cohort default rate certified in 2020 for an otherwise qualifying institution.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to also use the 3-year cohort default rate certified in 2020 to certify an otherwise qualifying institution for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u201327 academic years.\n\nExisting law requires each participating institution, as a condition for its voluntary participation in the Cal Grant Program, to annually report to the commission specified information regarding its undergraduate programs. Existing law requires the commission to provide on its internet website the information submitted by a Cal Grant participating institution pursuant to the reporting requirement described above and other information and links that are useful to students and parents who are in the process of selecting a college or university.\n\nThis bill would authorize the systemwide central office of a public postsecondary educational institution acting on behalf of the participating institution to annually report to the commission the information regarding the institution's undergraduate programs, as provided.

Existing law requires the chancellor's office to develop and submit an annual report on before September 1 to the Governor and the Legislature based on certain data and information relating to grants provided under the program, as reported by participating community colleges, and information on the use of program funds.\n\nThis bill would instead require the chancellor's office to develop and submit those reports triennially until September 1, 2030, as specified.\n\n(7) Existing law requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to adopt regulations providing for the payment of apportionments to community college districts on a specified schedule.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding the provision referenced above, would adjust the payment of apportionments to community college districts for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year to defer $408,363,000 of those payments to the 2026\u201327 fiscal year in accordance with a designated schedule. The bill would appropriate that amount to the board of governors for apportionments to community college districts for expenditure in the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, as specified.\n\n(8) Existing law authorizes the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to establish the Rising Scholars Network to enter into agreements with up to 65 community colleges to provide additional funds for services in support of postsecondary education for justice-involved students, as defined.\n\nThis bill would authorize the chancellor's office to enter into agreements with all community colleges, rather than up to 65 community colleges.\n\n(9) Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to establish, by March 31, 2019, an initiative to expand the use of course credit at the California Community Colleges for students with prior learning.

Existing law establishes a governing board to govern the data system and the Office of Cradle-to-Career Data as the managing entity required to implement and manage the data system.\n\nThis bill would establish the California Career Passport Program to be administered by the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, in partnership with the Office of Cradle-to-Career Data and the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, for the purpose of developing a Career Passport that provides individuals with a secure digital tool that displays their preparation for employment, academic records, and credit for prior learning, as specified.

The bill would require the chancellor's office to develop and report to the Department of Finance and the fiscal committees of the Legislature a timeline establishing target dates for key deliverables for the program, as specified.

The act establishes the Office of Student Assistance and Relief within the bureau to, among other things, assist students with submitting Student Tuition Recovery Fund claims to the bureau.\n\nThis bill would authorize the bureau to use moneys in the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to cover the costs of Student Tuition Recovery Fund claim administration and positions of the Office of Student Assistance and Relief. By expanding the purposes for which moneys from a continuously appropriated fund may be expended, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(11) Existing law imposes a filing fee of $605 to file a notice of appeal in a civil case. Existing law, until January 1, 2025, required that $65 of this fee be deposited into the former California State Law Library Special Account for the support of the California State Law Library.\n\nThis bill would reestablish the California State Law Library Special Account and would require, until July 1, 2030, $65 of each notice of appeal fee to be deposited into the California State Law Library Special Account for the support of the California State Law Library upon appropriation. The bill would specify that this requirement is intended to apply retroactively to January 1, 2025.\n\n(12) The Budget Act of 2023 made appropriations for local assistance to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, including $3,037,990,000 for apportionments.\n\nThis bill would amend the Budget Act of 2023 by reducing the appropriation made to the board of governors for apportionments by $67,001,000.\n\n(13) The Budget Act of 2024 made appropriations for local assistance to the board of governors for the 2024\u201325 fiscal year, including $3,904,892,000 for apportionments.\n\nThis bill would amend the Budget Act of 2024 by increasing the appropriation made to the board of governors for apportionments by $10,822,000.\n\n(14) The Budget Act of 2024, among other things, reappropriates $12,000,000 to the board of governors to support the development of e-Transcript California, as provided.\n\nThis bill would appropriate $6,558,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors to support the development of e-Transcript California pursuant to that provision.\n\n(15) This bill would appropriate $5,100,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors to provide grants through a community college district to California community-based organizations for financial aid outreach and application assistance supporting current and prospective community college students, as provided.\n\n(16) This bill would appropriate $20,000,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors to support emergency financial assistance grants to students attending a community college, as specified.\n\n(17) Existing law requires the California Community Colleges to designate on each of its campuses a Dreamer Resource Liaison to assist students in meeting certain requirements to be exempt from paying nonresident tuition by streamlining access to all available financial aid and academic opportunities for those students.\n\nThis bill would appropriate $15,000,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors to support Dreamer Resource Liaisons in assisting students, as described above.\n\n(18) The Budget Act of 2022, among other things, appropriates $10,000,000 to the board of governors to support the California Healthy School Food Pathway program, as provided.\n\nThis bill would appropriate $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the board of Governors to support the California Healthy School Food Pathway program.\n\n(19) This bill would appropriate $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors for transfer to a community college for allocation to the California Firefighter Joint Apprenticeship Council to conduct Emergency Medical Technician and Paramedic Preapprenticeship Training Academies.\n\n(20) This bill would appropriate $125,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors for allocation on a one-time basis to Santa Rosa Junior College for the construction of a fire academy tower.\n\n(21) Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to establish, by March 31, 2019, an initiative to expand the use of course credit at the California Community Colleges for students with prior learning.
