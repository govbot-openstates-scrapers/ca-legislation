Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care plans. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan, including a Medi-Cal managed care plan, or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan's or insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.\n\nThis bill would change the timeline for prior or concurrent authorization requests to no more than 3 business days from the plan's or insurer's receipt via electronic submission, or 5 business days from receipt via submission that is not electronic, of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. The bill would require a utilization review decision to be made within 24 hours from receipt of a prior or concurrent authorization request via electronic submission, or 48 hours from receipt via submission that is not electronic, if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would exclude Medi-Cal managed care plans from the above-described timeline changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
