A violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would expand those provisions to prohibit a retailer from selling nitrous oxide in any retail location.\n\n(2) Existing law, the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, classifies controlled substances into 5 designated schedules, with the most restrictive limitations generally placed on controlled substances classified in Schedule I, and the least restrictive limitations generally placed on controlled substances classified in Schedule V. Existing law places various criminal sanctions on the sale, distribution, and possession of specified controlled substances.\n\nThis bill would place 7-hydroxymitragynine on Schedule I, except as it naturally occurs in the plant Mitragyna speciosa.\n\n(3) By creating a new crime, and by expanding the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Juries: peremptory challenges."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
