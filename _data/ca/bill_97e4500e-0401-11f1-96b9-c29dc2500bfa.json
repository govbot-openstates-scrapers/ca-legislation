For the 4th and subsequent revisions of the housing element, existing law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to determine the existing and projected need for housing for each region, as provided, and requires the appropriate council of governments, or for cities and counties without a council of governments, the department, to adopt a final regional housing need plan allocating a share of the regional housing need to each city, county, or city and county, as provided. Existing law requires a city or county to provide by April 1 of each year an annual report to, among other entities, the department that includes, among other things, the city's or county's progress in meeting its share of regional housing needs, as specified. Existing law defines various terms for purposes of requirements applicable to the housing element.\n\nThis bill would define \"housing unit\" for the 7th and subsequent revisions of the housing element, with respect to acutely low income households, to mean a house, an apartment, a modular home, a mobilehome or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied, or, if vacant, is intended for occupancy as separate living quarters, as specified.\n\nBy revising requirements on local governments with regard to adopting or revising the housing element, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
