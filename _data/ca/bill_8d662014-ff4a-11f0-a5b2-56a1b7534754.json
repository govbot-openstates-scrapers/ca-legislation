Under existing law, a \"class 1 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that, among other things, provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. Under existing law, a \"class 2 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle and is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. Under existing law, a \"class 3 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a speedometer and a motor that, in pertinent part, provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 miles per hour. Existing law prohibits a person from selling a product or device that can modify the speed capability of an electric bicycle so that it no longer meets the definition of an electric bicycle. A violation of the Vehicle Code is an infraction.\n\nThis bill would also prohibit a person from selling an application that can modify the speed capability of an electric bicycle. By creating a new prohibition with respect to the modification of an electric bicycle, the violation of which is an infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
