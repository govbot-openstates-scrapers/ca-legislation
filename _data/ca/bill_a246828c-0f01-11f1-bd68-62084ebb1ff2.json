Existing law requires the instrument created pursuant to these provisions to be awarded based on a competitive solicitation process to the proposer providing the best value to the school district, as specified. Existing law authorizes a school district, for purposes of using preconstruction services, to enter into an instrument before written approval is obtained from the Department of General Services' Division of the State Architect under specified circumstances. Existing law authorizes a school district to identify specific types of subcontractors required to be included in a proposal, and imposes specified other procedural requirements on awarding construction subcontracts of a certain value.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of those provisions by 5 years by instead making the provisions described above inoperative on July 1, 2027, and repealing them as of January 1, 2028."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
