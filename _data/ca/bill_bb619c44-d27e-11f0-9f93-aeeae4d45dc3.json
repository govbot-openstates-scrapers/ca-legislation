Existing law requires research conducted by program grantees to include, but not be limited to, understanding biomarkers of exposure that quantify chemical carcinogens absorbed and metabolized by firefighters and studying biomarkers of effect that quantify cancer-promoting cellular changes that ultimately lead to a cancer diagnosis. \n\nThis bill would prohibit a city, county, or city and county from preventing a firefighter or fire department from voluntarily participating in a study undertaken pursuant to the above-described provisions, including allowing access to facilities and the use of equipment for the purposes of the terms of the grant."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
