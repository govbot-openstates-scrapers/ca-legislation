Existing law makes a violation of the act, as specified, a crime. Existing law requires an agreement to provide services pursuant to those provisions to, among other things, be in writing. Existing law requires the initial client service agreement and any amendment, addendum, or other modification to the agreement to be legible and clearly indicate any other document incorporated into it.\n\nThis bill would require a licensee to provide a copy of the initial client service agreement and any amendment, addendum, or other modification to the agreement in the preferred language of the client if the client primarily speaks a language other than English. The bill would specify that a violation of that provision is not a crime under the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
