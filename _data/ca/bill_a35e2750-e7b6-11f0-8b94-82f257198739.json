Existing law, the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) , establishes the Department of Cannabis Control (department) within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency to administer the act.\n\nMAUCRSA, among other things, consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis activities. MAUCRSA requires licensees to keep accurate records of commercial cannabis activity, including recording the sale or transport of cannabis or cannabis products from one licensee to another licensee on a sales invoice or receipt. MAUCRSA authorizes the department to suspend, revoke, place on probation with terms and conditions, or otherwise discipline licenses issued by the department and fine a licensee, as specified. \n\nThis bill, the Cannabis Payment Protection Act, would require the department to suspend the license of a licensee subject to a court order or civil judgment for failure to pay for goods and services sold or transferred by another licensee, if specified conditions are met, until the licensee complies with the terms of the court order or civil judgment. The bill would authorize the department to charge a fee to cover the reasonable administrative costs of implementing these provisions, as specified.\n\nAUMA authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions with a 23 vote of both houses to further its purposes and intent.\n\nThis bill would state that the bill furthers the purposes and intent of AUMA."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Cannabis."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
