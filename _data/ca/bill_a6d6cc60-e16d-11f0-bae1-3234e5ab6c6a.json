Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue an annual hunting license upon payment of a specified fee that varies in amount depending on the age and residency of the applicant. Under existing law, an annual hunting license is valid for a term of one year beginning on July 1 or for the remainder of the term if issued after July 1. Existing law also requires the department to issue a lifetime hunting license to a resident of the state upon payment of a specified fee that varies in amount depending on the age of the person.\n\nThis bill would require the department, beginning July 1, 2027, to ensure that every person who purchases a hunting license receives, at minimum, information on certain topics related to firearms, including the safe storage of firearms, liability for parents and guardians who should have known their child could access a firearm at home, basic California firearm laws, and how to legally transfer or relinquish a firearm. The bill would authorize the department, in cooperation with the Department of Justice, to promulgate regulations regarding the implementation of this requirement, and to include additional information to be provided with a hunting license."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
