A violation of these provisions is a crime. Under existing law, a general acute care hospital is required to provide certain basic services, including medical, nursing, surgical, anesthesia, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, and dietary services. Existing law authorizes a general acute care hospital to provide various special or supplemental services if certain conditions are met. Existing regulations define a supplemental service as an organized inpatient or outpatient service that is not required to be provided by law or regulation.\n\nThis bill would, beginning ____, include perinatal services as a basic service. The bill would require, on or before ____, the department to establish a process to approve or deny a \"perinatal service compliance plan\" to meet the requirement to provide perinatal services. The bill would require, on or before ____, any general acute care hospital that does not provide perinatal services to submit a \"perinatal service compliance plan to the department, with specified information. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
