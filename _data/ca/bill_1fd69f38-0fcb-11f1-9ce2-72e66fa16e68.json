Existing law requires the commission to require electrical corporations to implement various programs, such as energy efficiency programs, that are funded by electrical ratepayers.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before August 1, 2027, each large electrical corporation, as defined, to file a Tier 2 advice letter with the commission establishing an Industrial Decarbonization and Energy Efficiency Program with funding allocated from energy efficiency charges collected from eligible facilities, defined as industrial or manufacturing facilities that meet specified requirements, as specified. The bill would require the program to award grants to eligible facilities for eligible projects, including, among others, energy efficiency projects that meet certain requirements. The bill would require each large electrical corporation to administer the program, as provided, and require the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development to provide independent review and approval of grants awarded pursuant these provisions.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or an order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause the above provisions would be part of the Public Utilities Act and a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
