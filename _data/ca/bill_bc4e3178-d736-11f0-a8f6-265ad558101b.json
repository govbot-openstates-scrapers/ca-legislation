Existing law authorizes cremated remains or hydrolyzed human remains to be taken by boat from any harbor in this state, or by air, and scattered at sea. Existing law defines the phrase \"at sea\" to include the inland navigable waters of this state, exclusive of lakes and streams, provided that no such scattering may take place within 500 yards of the shoreline. Existing law specifies that these provisions do not allow the scattering of cremated human remains or hydrolyzed human remains from a bridge or pier.\n\nThis bill would additionally specify that these provisions do not allow the scattering of cremated human remains or hydrolyzed human remains from a dock attached to the shore. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health care service plans: financial risk requirement."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
