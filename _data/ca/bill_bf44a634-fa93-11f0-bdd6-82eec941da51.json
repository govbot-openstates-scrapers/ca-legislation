Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy that provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to cover medically necessary prescription drugs. \n\nFor a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, this bill would prohibit a health care service plan, health insurer, or pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in specified steering practices, including, among others, requiring an enrollee or insured to use a retail pharmacy for dispensing prescription oral medications, as specified, and imposing any requirements, conditions, or exclusions that discriminate against an in-network physician in connection with dispensing prescription oral medications. The bill would require a health care provider, physician's office, clinic, or infusion center to obtain consent from an enrollee or insured and disclose a good faith estimate of the enrollee's or insured's applicable cost-sharing amount before supplying or administering an injected or infused medication to an enrollee or insured, or sending an enrollee or insured to receive an injected or infused medication, if the setting or manner of administration is different than the setting or manner of administration for which the health care service plan, health insurer, or pharmacy benefit manager directed the enrollee or insured, as specified. Because a willful violation of these provisions relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
