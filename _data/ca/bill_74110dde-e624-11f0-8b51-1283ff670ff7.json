For purposes of implementing these provisions, existing law authorizes CHHSA and its departments, including the Department of Health Care Access and Information, to enter into exclusive or nonexclusive contracts on a bid or negotiated bases. Existing law exempts these contracts entered into by CHHSA and its departments from the review or approval of any division of the Department of General Services as well as from provisions pertaining to bidding and awarding of state contracts.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a state agency from awarding a contract, pursuant to the above provisions, on a noncompetitive basis for the purchase or acquisition of an opioid antagonist, as defined, with a contractor that has entered into a multistate settlement agreement for its role in contributing to the opioid epidemic. The bill would make a contract void and unenforceable for a violation of this provision and apply those provisions retroactively to contracts entered into before January 1, 2026."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
