Existing law also requires the cities, counties, and continuums of care to develop analyses and goals with victim service providers to address the specific needs of the above-described population with data measures not included within the Homeless Management Information System, in accordance with federal policies and specified guidelines.\n\nExisting law requires the Interagency Council on Homelessness to set and measure progress on goals to prevent and end homelessness among domestic violence survivors and their children and among unaccompanied women in California.\n\nThis bill would specifically include women with children in the populations described above. The bill would require the cities, counties, and continuums of care developing the analyses and goals described above to the Interagency Council on Homelessness. The bill would require the Interagency Council on Homelessness to post the analyses and goals on its website. By imposing new duties on cities and counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing."}, {"note": "", "title": "Housing and homelessness programs: single women with children."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
