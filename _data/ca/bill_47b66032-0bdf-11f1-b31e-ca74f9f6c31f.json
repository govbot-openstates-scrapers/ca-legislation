The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to provide information to the Division of Apprenticeship Standards to complete a report relating to the tax credit that would be established by the bill. The bill would make any information shared by the Franchise Tax Board subject to limitations relating to the sharing of taxpayer information, the violation of which is a crime. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Fast Food Council."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
