If the local government directs voters to the county voter information guide for tax rate information, the bill would require local elections officials to provide a measure information statement with the sample ballot for the election. The bill would require the measure information statement to include, among other things, a description of the purpose of the tax and how the revenue will be spent, a list of all tax rates expected to apply, and the duration of the tax. By requiring local elections officials to provide additional information to voters, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n Existing law requires local governments, when submitting a measure for voter approval for the issuance of bonds that will be secured by ad valorem property taxes, to mail voters a statement that includes estimates of the tax rates required to fund the bond debt.\n\nExisting law authorizes county and city elections officials to establish procedures to permit a voter to opt out of receiving a county voter information guide, state voter information guide, notice of polling place, and other associated materials by mail, and instead obtain them electronically by email or accessing the county's or city's internet website, if certain conditions are met.\n\nThis bill would authorize local governments to use those same procedures to electronically transmit the measure information statement and the statement including estimates of the tax rates required to fund bond debt.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Elections: local bond measures: tax rate statement."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
