Existing law similarly provides for the creation of junior accessory dwelling units by local ordinance or, if a local agency has not adopted an ordinance, by ministerial approval, in single-family residential zones in accordance with specified standards and conditions. Existing law generally prohibits a local agency from imposing additional standards, as specified, when evaluating a proposed accessory dwelling unit on a lot that includes a proposed or existing single-family dwelling. However, existing law authorizes a local agency to require that the property be used for rentals of terms 30 days or longer.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize a local agency to require the property owner to certify, as specified, that the accessory dwelling unit will be occupied as a residential dwelling unit for at least 6 months out of each calendar year. The bill would authorize the local agency to annually recertify, as specified, that the accessory dwelling unit is occupied as a residential dwelling unit for at least 6 months out of each calendar year. The bill would require the local agency, in enforcing the annual recertification provisions described above, to include at least 2 notices to the owner of the accessory dwelling unit, and would prohibit the local agency from, among other things, charging more than a reasonable fine for failure to comply with the above-described annual certification provisions, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State agencies: electronic transmission of information."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
