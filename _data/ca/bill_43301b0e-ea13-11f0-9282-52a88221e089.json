Existing law regulates the use and repair of weighing or measuring devices. Existing law authorizes a device to be placed in service only by a sealer or a service agency. Existing law prohibits, until January 1, 2028, requiring electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to be retested or placed in service by a service agency or sealer, if the EVSE has previously been placed in service by a service agency or sealer, before the EVSE is used after receiving maintenance, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize an EVSE that has been audited or tested by the manufacturer or supplier to be used commercially without further testing during the remainder of the inspection period adopted by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, but not until it has been sealed by a sealer. The bill would, among other things, require the county sealer to ensure that certain EVSE installed before January 1, 2026, are initially placed in service and tested by a sealer on or before January 1, 2027, at no additional cost other than the registration fees paid by the EVSE owner or operator. The bill would, until January 1, 2028, if an EVSE has previously been placed in service, no longer require the EVSE to be retested or placed in service by a service agency or sealer before the EVSE is used after receiving maintenance in a manner that does not affect the EVSE being correct. The bill would require the Division of Measurement Standards, on or before January 1, 2027, to issue guidance and develop statewide resources relevant to weights and measures for EVSE, as specified, and to consider and implement optional pathways for EVSE testing and placed-in-service requirements, including in-factory auditing or testing and certification by a factory- or supplier-registered service agency."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
