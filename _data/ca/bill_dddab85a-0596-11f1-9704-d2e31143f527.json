Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the contract cancellation option agreement, including prescribing the purchase price for the contract cancellation option and requiring specified disclosures. \n\nThis bill would enact the California Combating Auto Retail Scams (CARS) Act. The bill would define the terms \"vehicle\" and \"used vehicle\" for these purposes. The bill would make it a violation of the act for a dealer to make any misrepresentation regarding material information about specified matters relating to the vehicle sale, including the costs or terms of purchasing, financing, or leasing a vehicle, the availability of vehicles at a total price communicated by the dealer, and the remedy available if a dealer fails to sell or lease a vehicle at the total price, as defined. The bill would also make it a violation of the act for a dealer to fail to make certain disclosures clear and conspicuous, including specified information relating to the total price and any add-on products or services, and would exempt from that provision a used vehicle sold at an auction, as defined. The bill would make it a violation of the act for a dealer, in connection with the sale or financing of a vehicle, to charge for certain items, including an add-on product or service if the vehicle purchaser or lessee would not benefit from the add-on product or service. The bill would repeal the above-described contract cancellation option agreement requirement and would instead prohibit a dealer from selling or leasing specified used vehicles without providing the purchaser or lessee a 3-day right to cancel the purchase or lease, as provided. The bill would require a dealer to create and retain, for a period of 2 years from the date the record is created, all records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the act, including specified records. \n\nThe bill would make its provisions operative on October 1, 2026.\n\nThe bill would make related conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
