Existing law requires, for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012, the Franchise Tax Board to revise the individual taxpayer return form to allow a taxpayer to designate an amount in excess of tax liability to be deposited to the State Parks Protection Fund. Existing law entitles a taxpayer making a contribution to receive a single state parks day use annual pass from the Department of Parks and Recreation if the price of the pass, as determined by the department, is less than or equal to the amount of the taxpayer's contribution. Existing law allows a deduction for any contribution amount in excess of the price of the pass received, if any.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
