Existing law generally regulates classes of insurance, including fire insurance.\n\nThis bill would establish the Community Hardening Commission as an independent unit within the Department of Insurance, to be composed of specified members, including, among others, the Insurance Commissioner and the State Fire Marshal or their designee. The bill would require the Insurance Commissioner to be the chair of the commission. The bill would also require the commission to be advised by an advisory council consisting of specified members, including, among others, a local representative on behalf of a city or county, or association representing cities and counties, and a representative of the California Fire Chiefs Association. By imposing additional duties on local representatives of a city or county, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would also require the Insurance Commissioner, beginning January 1, 2026, and at least quarterly thereafter, to convene the commission to perform specified duties, including developing new wildfire community hardening standards to reduce fire risk and improve access to fire insurance. The bill would require the commission to make certain recommendations to the Insurance Commissioner, the Office of Emergency Services, and the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in accordance with specified standards. The bill would require the commission to consult with specified stakeholders, including those from public safety districts and the insurance industry, in performing the duties described above.\n\nThe bill would require the commission, on or before July 1, 2027, to complete the new standards described above and submit a report to the Legislature on additional actions needed to support cities, counties, and members of those communities in home hardening and wildfire mitigation. The bill would also require the commission to periodically review and update those standards, as specified. The bill would further authorize the commission to take various other related actions, including entering into confidential data sharing agreements and coordinating with the relevant legislative committees to secure documentation or specified information.\n\nThis bill would also require the Department of Insurance, on or before July 1, 2027, in consultation with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Office of Emergency Services, and the commission, to develop guidelines for state and local agencies to aggregate and make available data related to wildfire risk for purposes of a data sharing platform. \n\n(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
