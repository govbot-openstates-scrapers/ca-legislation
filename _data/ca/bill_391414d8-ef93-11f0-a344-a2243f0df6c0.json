Existing law requires certified programs and licensed facilities to disclose to the department if any of its agents, partners, directors, officers, or owners own or have a financial interest in a recovery residence and whether it has contractual relationships with entities that provide recovery services to clients of certified programs or licensed facilities if the entity is not a part of a certified program or a licensed facility. Existing law defines \"recovery residence\" as a residential dwelling that provides primary housing for individuals who seek a cooperative living arrangement that supports personal recovery from a substance use disorder and that does not require licensure by the department or does not provide licensable services.\n\nThis bill would require a business-operated recovery residence to register its location with the department. The bill would define a business-operated recovery residence as a recovery residence in which a business, in exchange for compensation, provides more than one service beyond those of a typical tenancy arrangement to more than one occupant, including, but not limited to, drug testing, supervision, scheduling, rule setting, rule enforcement, room assignment, entertainment, gym memberships, transportation, laundry, or meal preparation and coordination."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Alcohol and drug recovery or treatment facilities: discharge and continuing care planning."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
