{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1300", "title": "State and local government: data protection and privacy: immigration.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Stateandlocalgovernment", "dataprotectionandprivacy", "immigration"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires the Attorney General to publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement to the fullest extent possible consistent with federal and state law at public schools, public libraries, health facilities operated by the state or a political subdivision of the state, courthouses, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement facilities, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the Division of Workers Compensation, and shelters, and ensuring that they remain safe and accessible to all California residents, regardless of immigration status. Existing law requires the Attorney General to publish guidance, audit criteria, and training recommendations aimed at ensuring that any databases operated by state and local law enforcement agencies, including databases maintained for the agency by private vendors, are governed in a manner that limits the availability of information therein to the fullest extent practicable and consistent with federal and state law, to anyone or any entity for the purpose of immigration enforcement.\n\nExisting law, the California Values Act, prohibits California law enforcement agencies from using agency or department moneys or personnel to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect, or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes, including, among other things, providing personal information about an individual, making or intentionally participating in arrests based on civil immigration warrants, or performing the functions of an immigration officer, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a state or local government agency from collecting immigration-related personally identifiable information unless it is explicitly required by law to do so and the collection is justified by a legitimate government purpose. The bill would prohibit a state or local government agency from sharing personally identifiable information with federal immigration enforcement agencies without a judicial warrant or court order. The bill would require any contract, agreement, or memorandum of understanding that facilitate data sharing between a state or local government agency and federal immigration enforcement authorities to comply with oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with civil rights and privacy protections and be subject to review by the State Auditor, as described below. Because the bill would require local agencies to perform additional duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make these provisions enforceable by administrative action or by imposition of a civil penalty recovered by an action brought by the Attorney General.\n\nThis bill would require the State Auditor to conduct audits of all state and local government agency data-sharing agreements at least every 2 years to ensure compliance with existing laws protecting privacy and civil rights. The bill would require the Office of the Attorney General to establish an oversight task force to review complaints and violations related to unauthorized data collection and sharing that would report to the Legislature annually on data privacy trends, risks, and policy recommendations.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State government."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
