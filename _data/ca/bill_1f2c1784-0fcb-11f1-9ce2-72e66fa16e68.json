Alquist Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act of 1983, establishes, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health Care Access and Information, a program of seismic safety building standards for certain hospital buildings. Under existing law, a hospital building includes any building that is used, or designed to be used, for a health facility of a type required to be licensed, as specified. Under existing law, a hospital building does not include, among others, a freestanding building used, or designed to be used, as a congregate living health facility or a hospice facility.\n\nThis bill would exempt a general acute care hospital from the requirements of the act if, among other things, the hospital building is a freestanding building used, or designed to be used, exclusively to provide extended hospital care to patients with complex medical and rehabilitative needs and the hospital building has met all the seismic requirements that a hospital was required to meet prior to January 1, 2021."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
