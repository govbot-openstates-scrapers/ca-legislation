The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board as a part of the market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, upon appropriation, to administer a grant program to provide financial assistance to promote the in-state development of infrastructure, food waste prevention, or other projects to reduce organic waste, sort and aggregate or process organic and other recyclable materials into new, value-added products, or divert items from disposal through enhanced reuse opportunities. Existing law requires the grant program to provide eligible financial assistance for certain activities, including activities that expand and improve organic waste diversion and recycling, including, but not limited to, the recovery of food for human consumption and food waste prevention. Existing law specifies eligible infrastructure projects for purposes of the program, including, but not limited to, the construction of facilities to help develop, implement, or expand edible food waste recovery operations.\n\nThis bill would expand the grant program to provide financial assistance for the recovery of edible food, as specified. The bill would specify that eligible infrastructure projects includes the construction or expansion of facilities to help develop, implement, or expand edible food waste recovery operations. The bill would require the department to consider the increased amount of edible food recovery capacity that the project will create when awarding a grant for edible food recovery."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
