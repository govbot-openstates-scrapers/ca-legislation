Existing law authorizes the order to be issued solely on the affidavit or testimony of the person requesting the ex parte restraining order. Existing law requires the ex parte order to be issued or denied on the same day the application is submitted to the court, except as specified. Existing law prohibits an ex parte restraining order from being denied solely because the other party was not provided with notice.\n\nThis bill would instead prohibit a court from requiring that notice be provided to the party to be restrained in advance of filing an application for an ex parte restraining order."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
