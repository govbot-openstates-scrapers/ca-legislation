To receive that relief, existing law requires that the person establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the arrest or conviction was the direct result of being a victim of human trafficking, intimate partner violence, or sexual violence, which demonstrates that the person lacked the requisite intent to commit the offense. Existing law requires the court, under those circumstances, to find that the person lacked the requisite intent to commit the offense and to vacate the conviction as invalid due to legal defect at the time of the arrest or conviction. Existing law requires a court that issues an order for relief pursuant to these provisions to also order any law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the offense to seal and destroy their records of the offense.\n\nThis bill would expand that relief to also be available for persons who were convicted of or arrested for any offense committed when they were under the age of 18 and while they were a victim of human trafficking. Because this bill would authorize more petitions to be filed under penalty of perjury, by expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
