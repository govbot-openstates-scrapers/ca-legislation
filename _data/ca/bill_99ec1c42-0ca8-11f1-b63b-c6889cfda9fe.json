Existing law requires, by January 1, 2027, a public safety agency that provides \"911\" call processing services for emergency medical response to provide prearrival medical instructions to \"911\" callers requiring medical assistance, including, among other things, CPR instructions for children and children and adults. Existing law also requires persons providing aquatic instruction at a public swimming pool to possess current certificates from an American Red Cross or a YMCA of the USA lifeguard training program, or have equivalent qualifications, as determined by the State Department of Public Health, and requires lifeguard service, as defined, to be provided for any public swimming pool that is of wholly artificial construction and for the use of which a direct fee is charged. \n\nThis bill would clarify that CPR instructions, for purposes of the above-described \"911\" provision, also include CPR instruction in both ventilation and chest compressions for calls that involve a drowning victim. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health, in coordination with other specified state entities, to review and update the state's public communications efforts to ensure everyone in California is educated about the importance of CPR knowledge and how to obtain CPR training.\n\nThis bill would also require the Emergency Medical Services Authority to, on or before June 30, 2028, and biennially thereafter, submit a report to the Commission on Emergency Medical Services and the Legislature on California's lifeguard workforce, as prescribed, to better understand, track, and report on California's lifeguard workforce."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
