{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1458", "title": "Physical therapy and veterinary medicine: animal physical therapy.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Physicaltherapyandveterinarymedicine", "animalphysicaltherapy"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Physical Therapy Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of physical therapists by the Physical Therapy Board of California (Physical Therapy Board) , which is within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law defines physical therapy as the art and science of physical or corrective rehabilitation or of physical or corrective treatment of any bodily or mental condition of any person by the use of the physical, chemical, and other properties of heat, light, water, electricity, sound, massage, and active, passive, and resistive exercise. Existing law makes a violation of the Physical Therapy Practice Act a misdemeanor. \n\nExisting law, the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of veterinarians and the practice of veterinary medicine by the California Veterinary Medical Board, which is within the Department of Consumer Affairs. That act makes it unlawful for any person to practice veterinary medicine in this state without a license and provides that the practice of veterinary medicine includes, among other things, the treatment of whatever nature for the prevention, cure, or relief of a wound, fracture, bodily injury, or disease of an animal. Existing law makes a violation of the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act a misdemeanor. \n\nThis bill would authorize a licensed physical therapist who meets specified education, training, and experience requirements to provide animal physical therapy, as specified. The bill would require the physical therapist to notify the Physical Therapy Board of their practice of animal physical therapy, as prescribed. The bill would require the animal physical therapy to be provided under either of 2 sets of circumstances involving a licensed veterinarian who has established a veterinary-patient-client relationship with the animal. The first set of circumstances would be under the direct supervision of the veterinarian at a premises registered with the California Veterinary Medical Board. The second set of circumstances would be pursuant to a referral from the veterinarian, would require the physical therapist to provide a specified written notification to the owner of the animal patient, and would require the physical therapist to hold an active practice agreement with the licensed veterinarian. The bill would require the physical therapist to provide a written copy of that active practice agreement to the California Veterinary Medical Board or Physical Therapy Board upon request. The bill would authorize physical therapy aides to aid the physical therapist in performing animal physical therapy, as specified. The bill would make any physical therapist providing animal physical therapy solely liable for delegated animal physical therapy tasks performed pursuant to a referral from a licensed veterinarian or by a person under the direct supervision of the physical therapist. The bill would specify that a veterinarian who issues an order for treatment for animal physical therapy is not liable for the animal physical therapy provided pursuant to that order by the physical therapist or by an aide or other assistant supervised by the physical therapist.\n\nThe bill would make certain disciplinary actions against a Physical Therapy Practice Act licensee by the California Veterinary Medical Board conclusive evidence of unprofessional conduct by the licensee under the Physical Therapy Practice Act. The bill would require the Physical Therapy Board to immediately notify the California Veterinary Medical Board of any disciplinary actions or practice restrictions placed on the license of a physical therapist who has notified the Physical Therapy Board of their practice of animal physical therapy. The bill would prohibit a physical therapist whose license is suspended, revoked, or otherwise disciplined by the Physical Therapy Board from providing animal physical therapy. The bill would specify that these provisions, among other things, do not authorize an unlicensed person to practice animal physical therapy, except for physical therapy aides as described above.\n\nThe bill would make a failure to comply with specified supervision requirements imposed by the bill or any regulation adopted pursuant to these provisions unprofessional conduct and grounds for disciplinary action, as prescribed. The bill would prohibit a physical therapist providing animal physical therapy from supervising or delegating any animal physical therapy, except as specified. The bill would specify that these provisions, among other things, do not authorize a physical therapist to provide any other services or perform any acts which constitute veterinary medicine.\n\nThe bill would define various terms for the purposes of the above-described provisions. By imposing additional requirements and prohibitions under the Physical Therapy Practice Act and the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, a violation of either of which is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Animal physical therapy."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
