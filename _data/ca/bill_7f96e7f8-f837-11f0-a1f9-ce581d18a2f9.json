Existing law defines \"food insecurity\" to mean the occasional or constant lack of access to the food one needs to live a healthy life and the uncertainty of being able to acquire enough food to meet the needs of an individual or household due to insufficient money or other resources. \n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Social Services to annually conduct a statewide survey to assess food insecurity in the state, modeled after a specified federal survey. The bill would require the first statewide food insecurity survey to be completed on or before July 1, 2027. The bill would require the department, on or before October 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, to make the results of the statewide food insecurity survey publicly available on its internet website.
