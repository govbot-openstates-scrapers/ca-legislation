{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB161", "title": "State employment: state bargaining units.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Stateemployment", "statebargainingunits"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law provides that a provision of a memorandum of understanding reached between the state employer and a recognized employee organization representing state civil service employees that requires the expenditure of funds does not become effective unless approved by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act. \n\nExisting law requires the Department of Human Resources to provide a memorandum of understanding to the Legislative Analyst, who then has 10 calendar days from the date the tentative agreement is received to issue a fiscal analysis to the Legislature. Existing law prohibits the memorandum of understanding from being subject to legislative determination until either the Legislative Analyst has presented a fiscal analysis of the memorandum of understanding or until 10 calendar days have elapsed since the memorandum was received by the Legislative Analyst. \n\nThis bill, notwithstanding the above-described statutory provisions, would approve provisions of the agreements entered into by the state employer and specified state bargaining units. The bill would provide that the provisions of the agreements that require the expenditure of funds will not take effect unless funds for these provisions are specifically appropriated by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the state employer or the bargaining units to reopen negotiations if funds for these provisions are not specifically appropriated by the Legislature. The bill would require the provisions of the agreement that require the expenditure of funds to become effective even if the provisions are approved by the Legislature in legislation other than the annual Budget Act. By approving provisions of the agreements that require the expenditure of funds, this bill would make an appropriation. \n\n(2) Existing law, for the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment and compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by specified memoranda of understanding if the Budget Act of 2026 is not enacted by July 1, 2026. \n\nThis bill would additionally include the memoranda of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 8 (effective July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2027, inclusive) and State Bargaining Unit 18 (effective July 1, 2025, to July 1, 2028, inclusive) .\n\nExisting law, for the 2027\u201328 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment and compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by specified memoranda of understanding if the Budget Act of 2027 is not enacted by July 1, 2027. \n\nThis bill would additionally include the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 18 (effective July 1, 2025, to July 1, 2028, inclusive) .\n\nExisting law, for the 2028\u201329 fiscal year, continuously appropriates to the Controller from the General Fund unallocated special funds, including federal funds and unallocated nongovernmental cost funds, and any other fund from which state employees are compensated, the amount necessary for the payment and compensation and employee benefits to state employees covered by the memoranda of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 6 and State Bargaining Unit 16, if the Budget Act of 2028 is not enacted by July 1, 2028.\n\nThis bill would additionally include the memorandum of understanding for State Bargaining Unit 18 (effective July 1, 2025, to July 1, 2028, inclusive) .\n\n(3) Existing law states that it is the policy of the state that the workweek of the state employee shall be 40 hours, and the workday of state employees 8 hours, except that workweeks and workdays of a different number of hours may be established in order to meet the varying needs of the different state agencies. \n\nExisting law also requires state employees in specified bargaining units, except as specified, from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027, inclusive, to participate in the Personal Leave Program 2025 (PLP 2025) , either as required by an applicable memorandum of understanding reached or by the direction of the department for excluded employees, under which each employee receives a reduction in pay not greater than certain listed amounts in exchange for a specified number of hours per month of PLP 2025 leave credits. \n\nThis bill would also require state employees in State Bargaining Units 8, 10, and 18 to participate in the PLP 2025, either as required by an applicable memorandum of understanding or by the direction of the department for excluded employees, as prescribed. Under the program, in exchange for a reduction in pay not greater than certain listed amounts, those employees would receive monthly PLP 2025 leave credits, subject to certain exclusions.\n\n(4) The Public Employees' Retirement Law (PERL) creates the Public Employees' Retirement System for the purpose of providing public employees pension and other benefits, which are funded by employee and employer contributions and investment returns. Contributions and investment returns are deposited in the Public Employees' Retirement Fund, which is continuously appropriated for the payment of benefits and administration of the system. PERL vests management and control of PERS in its board of administration. PERL and labor agreements prescribe different normal rates of contribution for employees depending on bargaining unit, employer, and inclusion of service in the federal social security system, among other factors. \n\nUnder PERL, effective July 1, 2021, the normal contribution rates for state miscellaneous or state industrial members who are represented by State Bargaining Unit 18 are adjusted in accordance with specified procedures based on changes in normal cost rates, as determined by the board.\n\nThis bill would change the above-described effective date to July 1, 2027. The bill would also provide that, effective July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027, specified employee contributions for state miscellaneous and industrial members represented by State Bargaining Unit 18 shall remain in place.\n\nUnder PERL, effective July 1, 2021, the normal contribution rates for state safety members who are represented by State Bargaining Unit 18 are adjusted in accordance with specified procedures based on changes in normal cost rates, as determined by the board.\n\nThis bill would change the above-described effective date to July 1, 2027. The bill would also provide that, effective July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027, specified employee contributions for state safety members represented by State Bargaining Unit 18 shall remain in place. The bill would make other related and conforming changes to these provisions on normal cost rates.\n\n(5) The Public Employees' Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA) , which is administered by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System, prescribes methods for calculating the state employer contribution for postemployment health care benefits for eligible retired public employees and their families and for the vesting of these benefits. PEMHCA establishes the Annuitants' Health Care Coverage Fund, which is continuously appropriated, for the purpose of prefunding health care coverage for annuitants, including administrative costs. \n\nPEMHCA requires employees in State Bargaining Unit 10 to prefund retiree health care and requires the state to make a matching contribution. PEMHCA suspended the employees' monthly contribution for prefunding other postemployment benefits for the 2020\u201321 fiscal year for State Bargaining Unit 10.\n\nThis bill would suspend the employee and employer monthly contribution for prefunding other postemployment benefits for State Bargaining Unit 10, effective the first day of the pay period following ratification by both parties, for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u20132027 fiscal years.\n\nPEMHCA requires certain state employees in the judicial branch to make contributions to prefund retiree health care based on a specified schedule and requires the state to make a matching contribution.\n\nThis bill would suspend the employee and employer monthly contribution for prefunding other postemployment benefits for those judicial branch employees, effective July 31, 2025, for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u20132027 fiscal years.\n\nPEMHCA requires employees in State Bargaining Unit 18 to prefund retiree health care and requires the state to make a matching contribution. PEMHCA suspends the employee and employer monthly contribution for prefunding other postemployment benefits for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u201327 fiscal years.\n\nThis bill would provide that, effective July 1, 2027, the amount of the employee and employer contributions required to prefund retiree health care shall be based on a specified schedule, beginning with 1.5% of pensionable compensation on July 1, 2027, and increasing to 4.5 % of pensionable compensation on July 1, 2029. Beginning July 1, 2030, the bill would require both the employer and employee contribution percentages to be increased or decreased to maintain a 50% cost sharing of actuarially determined normal costs, as prescribed. The bill would make various related and conforming changes to those provisions on retiree health care costs.\n\n(6) The Budget Act of 2025 makes various appropriations for the purpose of employee compensation. \n\nThis bill would revise specified Budget Act items, for a total increase of $14,597,000, pursuant to agreements reached between the state employer and State Bargaining Units 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, and 21, in accordance with a specified schedule.\n\n(7) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
