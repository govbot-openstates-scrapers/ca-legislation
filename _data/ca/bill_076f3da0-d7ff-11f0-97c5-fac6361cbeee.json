The housing element is required to be updated at specified intervals, and when updating the housing element, the local government is required to take into account regional housing needs for various income levels, as specified. Existing law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to determine whether the housing element is in substantial compliance with specified provisions of the Planning and Zoning Law, and requires HCD to designate jurisdictions as prohousing, as prescribed.\n\nThe Planning and Zoning Law also provides for the creation of an accessory dwelling unit by local ordinance, or, if a local agency has not adopted an ordinance, by ministerial approval, in accordance with specified standards. The law prohibits a local agency from imposing certain standards, except as specified, when evaluating a proposed accessory dwelling unit.\n\nExisting law, commonly referred to as the Density Bonus Law, requires a city or county to provide a developer that proposes a housing development, as defined, within the city or county with a density bonus, waivers or reductions of development standards and parking ratios, and other incentives or concessions, as specified, if the developer agrees to construct, among other options, specified percentages of units for lower income households or very low income households, and meets other requirements.\n\nThis bill would authorize a housing-forward jurisdiction, defined to mean a city, county, or city and county that is designated as a prohousing jurisdiction by HCD and has met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need allocation, as provided, to impose certain conditions on a development project, including prohibiting a developer from using a density bonus benefit, as defined, to reduce the number of bicycle parking or storage spaces, and requiring an impact fee for specified accessory dwelling units."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: permitted use: housing forward jurisdictions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
