Among those rights, the CCPA includes the right to request that a business delete personal information that the business has collected from the consumer.\n\nThis bill would expand that right to include requesting the deletion of any personal information that the business has collected about the consumer. If the business did not obtain the personal information from the consumer, the bill would allow the business to retain a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary to ensure the consumer's personal information remains deleted from its records and is not being used for any other purpose.\n\nExisting law generally requires businesses to make certain methods of communication available for consumers to submit personal information requests, including requests for deletion and correction. If a business operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with the consumer from whom it collects personal information, existing law requires the business to provide consumers an email address for submitting personal information requests.\n\nThis bill would also require that business to make an online method, such as a web form or online portal, available to consumers for submitting personal information requests.\n\nExisting law, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an initiative measure approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA.\n\n This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes and intent of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
