The act is enforced by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act defines a \"private postsecondary educational institution\" as a private entity with a physical presence in the state that offers postsecondary education to the public for an institutional charge. The act requires an out-of-state private postsecondary educational institution, as defined, to register with the bureau, pay a fee, and comply with delineated requirements unless the institution is exempt from complying with these requirements. Existing law repeals the act on January 1, 2027.\n\nThis bill would require the bureau to exempt from the act a nonprofit private postsecondary educational institution that meets specified conditions, including that the institution is headquartered outside of this state and assumes ownership or operational control of an existing private postsecondary educational institution campus located in the County of Alameda that is imminently facing closure, as provided.\n\nThe bill would also authorize the bureau to adopt regulations that require a private postsecondary educational institution operating in the County of Alameda to provide not less than 24 months' advance written notice to the bureau before ceasing operations, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for private postsecondary educational institutions operating in the County of Alameda."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
