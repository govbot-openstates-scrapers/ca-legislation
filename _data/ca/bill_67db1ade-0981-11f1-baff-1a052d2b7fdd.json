CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nExisting law exempts from CEQA, except when located on natural and protected lands, as defined, a project that consists exclusively of a daycare center, as specified, a project that consists exclusively of a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic, as specified, a project that consists exclusively of a nonprofit food bank or food pantry, as specified, and a project that consists exclusively of a facility for advanced manufacturing, as specified.\n\nThis bill would state that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation that would, among other things, provide that projects exempted from CEQA pursuant to the above-described provisions remain subject to, and in compliance with, all applicable state laws intended to protect public health, safety, and the environment."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
