The bill would require a pharmacist, for each federal Food and Drug Administration-approved nonhormonal contraceptives initiated, to provide the recipient with a standardized fact sheet, as specified.\n\nExisting law prohibits a pharmacist, pharmacist's employer, or pharmacist's agent from directly charging a patient a separate consultation fee for emergency contraception drug therapy services and requires the pharmacist to disclose the total retail price of the emergency contraception drug therapy. Existing law makes those provisions inoperative for dedicated emergency contraception drugs if these drugs are reclassified as over-the-counter products by the federal Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis bill would delete those provisions.\n\nExisting law requires a pharmacist to dispense, at a patient's request, up to a 12-month supply of an FDA-approved, self-administered hormonal contraceptive.\n\nThis bill would, instead, make those provisions applicable to contraceptives.\n\nThis bill would make related conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pharmacists: self-administered FDA-approved nonhormonal contraceptives."}, {"note": "", "title": "Electric bicycles: disclosure."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
