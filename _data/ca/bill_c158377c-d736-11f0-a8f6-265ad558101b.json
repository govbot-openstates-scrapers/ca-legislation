The bill would require the commission to adopt an expedited review and approval process for ratesetting proceedings for an exempt railroad crossing application, as defined. The bill also would require the commission, upon initiating a ratesetting proceeding, to determine whether the proceeding is for an exempt railroad crossing application, and if so, to issue a proposed resolution pursuant to the expedited review and approval process."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
