Existing law requires the state board to inventory sources of air pollution within the air basins of the state, determine the kinds and quantity of air pollutants, and monitor air pollutants in cooperation with districts and other agencies.\n\nThis bill would require the state board to expand its incident air monitoring program, subject to an appropriation by the Legislature for those purposes, to provide support for a regional network of air quality incident response centers operated by air districts, including at least one located in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, in order to facilitate emergency air monitoring response at the local and regional level. Prior to the state board establishing an air quality incident response center within an air district, the bill would require the state board to coordinate and develop operational plans for the air quality incident response centers with the relevant air districts. The bill would provide that funding made available to the state board for purposes of these provisions may be used for various purposes, including program funding to plan, create, equip, and maintain air quality incident response centers.\n\nTo the extent that the bill would expand the duties of an air district, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Vehicular air pollution: State Air Resources Board: regulations."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
