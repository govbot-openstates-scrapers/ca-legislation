CEQA does not apply to the approval of ministerial projects.\n\nExisting law, the Planning and Zoning Law, authorizes a development proponent to submit an application for a multifamily housing development that is subject to a streamlined, ministerial approval process, as provided, and not subject to a conditional use permit, if the development satisfies specified objective planning standards.\n\nThis bill would authorize a development proponent to submit an application for a housing development that is subject to a streamlined, ministerial approval process if the development is for single-family housing in which each unit is 1,600 square feet or less and the development is consistent with objective planning and design standards. By establishing a streamlined, ministerial approval process for certain housing developments, this bill would expand the exemption for the ministerial approval of projects under CEQA. By expanding the duties of local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public postsecondary education: University of California: contracting for services."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
