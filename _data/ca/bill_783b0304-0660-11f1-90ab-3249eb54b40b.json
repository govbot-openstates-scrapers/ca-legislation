{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB975", "title": "Nursing schools and programs: faculty members, directors, and assistant directors.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Nursingschoolsandprograms", "facultymembers,directors,andassistantdirectors"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Nursing Practice Act, establishes the Board of Registered Nursing in the Department of Consumer Affairs to license and regulate the practice of nursing. A violation of the act is a crime. Existing law imposes specified duties on the board related to the approval and regulation of schools of nursing and nursing programs whose graduates are eligible to apply for a license to practice nursing. In this regard, existing law requires the executive officer of the board to develop a uniform method for evaluating requests and granting approvals. If the board requires the approval of the faculty or directors, as described, existing law authorizes the board to approve an individual to serve as a member of the faculty, director, or assistant director of an approved school of nursing or nursing program. Existing law requires the board to approve an applicant for individual approval if the applicant submits a completed application, as specified, demonstrating that the applicant meets the requirements established by the board for faculty, directors, and assistant directors of an approved school of nursing or nursing program. If an applicant for approval has a faculty position and does not meet a requirement established by the board for a different position, existing law authorizes the board to accept a remediation plan, as specified. If the board accepts the above-described remediation plan, existing law authorizes the board to approve the applicant to instruct in theory under the mentorship and supervision of the content expert, as specified. \n\nThis bill would, instead, require the board to approve an applicant for individual approval if the applicant submits a completed application, as specified, demonstrating that the applicant meets the requirements established by the board for faculty, directors, and assistant directors of an approved school of nursing or nursing program, and, if needed, an approved remediation plan. The bill would, instead, authorize the board to accept a remediation plan, as specified, if an applicant for approval at a California Community College with an approved school of nursing or nursing program does not meet a requirement established by the board for a different position, and to approve the applicant to instruct in theory under the mentorship and supervision of the content expert, as specified, if the board accepts the above-described remediation plan for faculty. The bill would require the board to approve the applicant to serve under the mentorship of a board-approved director or assistant director if the board accepts the above-described remediation plan for nursing directors or assistant directors. Because the bill would expand the scope of a crime under the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
