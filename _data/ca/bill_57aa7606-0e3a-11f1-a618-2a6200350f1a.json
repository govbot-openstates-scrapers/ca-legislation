The California Constitution requires in each house the section and the bill to be passed separately, each by rollcall vote entered in the journal, 23 of the membership concurring. \n\nThis measure would require a bill that reduces a direct benefit payment to an individual with a disability to only be passed by the enactment of an urgency statute and would prohibit the bill from including any other unrelated provisions. The measure would specify that its provisions only apply to SSP, CAPI, the state disability insurance program, and the workers' compensation system, as specified. The measure would make its provisions self-executing and severable."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
