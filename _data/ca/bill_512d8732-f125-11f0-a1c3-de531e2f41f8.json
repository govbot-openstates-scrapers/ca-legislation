The bill would also require OES to, no later than December 1, 2027, ensure that technologies enabling text or chat contacts between a caller and 988 centers or a specified subnetwork are available.\n\nThis bill would require the California Health and Human Services Agency to, no later than July 1, 2027, administer a grant program for qualified entities that specialize in suicide prevention services and provide funding for state 988 call centers to implement specified goals. The bill would require the agency to determine the eligibility criteria, as prescribed, grant application process, and methodology for the distribution of grants to a qualified entity. The bill would require a qualified entity to annually file an expenditure and outcomes report, as specified, in a form and manner determined by the agency. The bill would establish the Protecting Suicide Prevention Resources for LGBTQ+ Youth Fund, to be administered by the agency, and would appropriate $5,000,000 from the General Fund to the Protecting Suicide Prevention Resources for LGBTQ+ Youth Fund for purposes of these provisions.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
