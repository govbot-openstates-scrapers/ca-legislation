Existing law requires the department, after consultation with and approval by the California Conference of Local Health Officers, to establish by regulation standards of education and experience for professional and technical personnel employed in local health departments and for the organization and operation of the local health departments. \n\nExisting law establishes the Adult Education Program under the administration of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The program requires the chancellor and the Superintendent, with the advice of the Executive Director of the State Board of Education, to divide the state into adult education regions and to approve one adult education consortium in each adult education region, as specified. Existing law requires that funds apportioned for the adult education program be used solely for specified programs, including, among other things, programs for adults, including, but not limited to, older adults, that are primarily related to entry or reentry into the workforce. \n\nThis bill would authorize local health departments to establish older adult education programs in collaboration with relevant local entities including, among other entities, school districts. If a local health department establishes an older adult education program, the bill would require the program to include communal meals and specified instruction. The bill would authorize a school district to act as the fiscal agent for an older adult education program and, if a school district serves as the fiscal agent, would authorize the school district to use available local, public health, or philanthropic funds for the program. The bill would prohibit a school district from being required to divert funding from adult education programs or elementary and secondary education programs for the older adult education program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
