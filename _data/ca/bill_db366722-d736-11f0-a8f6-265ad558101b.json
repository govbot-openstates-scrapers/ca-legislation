The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law requires that Medi-Cal provider payments and payments for specified non-Medi-Cal programs be reduced by 10% for dates of service on and after June 1, 2011, and conditions implementation of those payment reductions on receipt of any necessary federal approvals. Existing law, for dates of service on and after July 1, 2022, authorizes the maintenance of the reimbursement rates or payments for specified services, including, among others, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) trauma screenings and specified providers, using General Fund or other state funds appropriated to the State Department of Health Care Services as the state share, at the payment levels in effect on December 31, 2021, as specified, under the California Healthcare, Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016 that were implemented with funds from the Healthcare Treatment Fund, as specified. Existing law requires the department to develop the eligibility criteria, methodologies, and parameters for the payments and rate increases maintained, and would authorize revisions, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department, as part of its above-described duties, to include (1) community-based organizations and local health jurisdictions that provide health services through community health workers and (2) doulas, that are enrolled Medi-Cal providers, as providers qualified to provide, and eligible to receive payments for, ACEs trauma screenings pursuant to the provisions described above. The bill would require the department to require these providers to make clinical or other appropriate referrals, as specified, as a condition of payment for conducting ACEs trauma screenings. The bill would require the department to file a state plan amendment and seek any federal approvals it deems necessary to implement these provisions and condition implementation on receipt of any necessary federal approvals and the availability of federal financial participation. The bill would also require the department to update its internet website and the ACEs Aware internet website to reflect the addition of the Medi-Cal providers described above as authorized to provide ACEs screenings. The bill would authorize the department to implement, interpret, or make specific these provisions by means of a provider manual, provider bulletins or notices, policy letters, or other similar instructions, without taking regulatory action."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
