Existing law requires funding pursuant to the local control funding formula to include, in addition to a base grant, supplemental and concentration grant add-ons that are based on the percentage of unduplicated pupils, defined as those pupils who are English learners, foster youth, or eligible for free or reduced-price meals, served by the county superintendent of schools, school district, or charter school, as specified. Existing law, commencing with the 2021\u201322 fiscal year, requires the concentration grant add-on to be equal to 65% of the base grant for each school district's or charter school's percentage of unduplicated pupils in excess of 55% of the school district's or charter school's total enrollment. Existing law prohibits a charter school's percentage of unduplicated pupils from exceeding the percentage of unduplicated pupils of the school district in which the charter school is physically located, or the highest percentage of unduplicated pupils of the school districts in which the charter school has a school facility, as applicable.\n\nThis bill would authorize a charter school subject to the above-described prohibitions to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for a waiver from the applicable limitation and to instead have its concentration grant calculated based on the charter school's percentage of unduplicated pupils in excess of 55 percent of the charter school's total enrollment. The bill would require the Superintendent to develop guidelines and procedures for these purposes and to grant the waiver if specified conditions are met, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
