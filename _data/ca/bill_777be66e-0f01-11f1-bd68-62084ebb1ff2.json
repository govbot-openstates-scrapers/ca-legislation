Existing law also requires a local agency to post examples for specified types of housing development projects, including, but not limited to, an accessory dwelling unit, duplex, multifamily, mixed-use, and townhome. Existing law requires a local agency to consider ministerially a proposed housing development containing no more than 2 residential units within a single-family residential zone if the housing development meets certain requirements.\n\nThis bill, commencing on January 1, 2028, would revise the posting requirement to additionally require a local agency to post examples for a junior accessory dwelling unit and a housing development project that the local agency has ministerially approved pursuant to the above-described process. By increasing duties on a local agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
