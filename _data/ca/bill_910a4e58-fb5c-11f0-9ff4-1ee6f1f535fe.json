The bill would require the lists to be kept confidential, as specified. The bill would also require the agency to upload the lists to the accessible deletion mechanism described above and would require an entity receiving a notification that a deletion is required to do so within 5 days.\n\nThis bill would authorize an elected official or judge who is on a list described above, the Attorney General, a county counsel, or a city attorney to bring a civil action for a violation of the bill, as prescribed.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Data brokers: personal information of threatened elected officials, judges, and their immediate family members."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act: personal information of elected and appointed officials."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
