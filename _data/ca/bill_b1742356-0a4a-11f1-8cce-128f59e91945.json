Existing law regulates the provision of these rights.\n\nThis bill, the Hug Act, would require that all youth confined in a juvenile facility have the right to engage in certain types of nonsexual physical contact during in-person visits, as provided. The bill would require all juvenile facilities to establish regulations and procedures consistent with this requirement. To the extent that this bill would impose a higher level of service on local facilities, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
