The act requires the commission to ensure that errors in estimates of demand elasticity or sales do not result in material overcollections or undercollections of electrical corporations.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the commission to ensure that those errors do not result in material overcollections or undercollections of water corporations.\n\nExisting law requires the commission, in establishing rates for water service, to consider separate charges for costs associated with customer service, facilities, variable operating costs, or other components of the water service provided to water users. Existing law requires the commission to consider, and authorizes the commission to authorize, a water corporation to establish programs, including rate designs, for achieving conservation of water and recovering the cost of these programs through the rates, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, for purposes of the above-described rates for water service, require that any changes to rates or implementation of surcharges in accordance with the above-described requirement on the commission to ensure errors in estimates of demand elasticity or sales do not result in material overcollections or undercollections of water corporations do not result in revenues above those approved by the commission.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause the above requirements would be part of the act and a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Water corporations: demand elasticity."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
