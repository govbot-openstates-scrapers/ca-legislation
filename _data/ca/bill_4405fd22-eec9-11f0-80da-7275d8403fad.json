Existing law exempts specified entities from this permit requirement under certain circumstances. Existing law requires the Fish and Game Commission, in cooperation with the Department of Food and Agriculture, to adopt regulations governing, among other things, the confinement of a wild animal possessed under a restricted species permit and the possession of all other wild animals. Existing law requires those regulations to be designed to, among other things, provide for the welfare of wild animals and the safety of the public.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person from allowing any member of the public to come into direct contact, as defined, with a covered animal, as defined, except as provided. The bill would provide that any person who violates this provision is subject to a specified civil penalty for each violation, and that the restricted species permit for the covered animal is subject to immediate suspension or revocation by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The bill would authorize a person whose permit is suspended or revoked to appeal the suspension or revocation to the commission by filing a written request for an appeal within 30 days of the suspension or revocation.\n\nThis bill would provide that the provisions of this bill are severable."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
