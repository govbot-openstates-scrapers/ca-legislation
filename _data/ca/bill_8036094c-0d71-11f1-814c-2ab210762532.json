The act requires property acquired or developed with the grant money to be used by the grant recipient only for the purpose for which the grant moneys were requested and prohibits any other use of the area except by a specific act of the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would provide that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation that would authorize the City of Cathedral City to remove from public recreational use, and use as a fire station, a portion of park property in the city acquired or improved with the grant moneys from the above acts, subject to the acquisition of replacement park property of equal or greater recreational value approved by the Department of Parks and Recreation, to be used for park purposes, and at no cost to the state."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
