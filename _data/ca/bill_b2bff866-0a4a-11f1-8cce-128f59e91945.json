Under existing law, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, compound, furnish, sell, or dispense a dangerous drug or dangerous device, or to dispense or compound a prescription unless they are licensed, as specified. Existing law exempts a manufacturer or wholesaler that provides dialysis drugs and devices directly to patients from these provisions and authorizes the distribution of drugs and devices directly to dialysis patients pursuant to regulations adopted by the board and other specified conditions.\n\nThis bill would also exempt a manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor that furnishes enteral nutrition products directly to a patient's residence, as specified, from these provisions. The bill would also authorize a pharmacist or an exempted manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor to distribute enteral nutrition products directly to patients with medically diagnosed conditions that preclude the full use of regular food pursuant to regulations adopted by the board.
