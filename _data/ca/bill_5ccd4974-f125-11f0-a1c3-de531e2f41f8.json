The bill would require the commission to ensure an energy storage system that submits an application after January 1, 2026, complies with setback requirements that are at least as protective as the most recently published edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 855, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Power facilities: emergency response and action plan."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
