Under existing law, the employee's or annuitant's contribution is the total cost per month of coverage less the portion contributed by the employer. Existing law prescribes a minimum level for the employer's contribution toward the employee's or annuitant's health benefits coverage. Existing law provides that the provisions governing PEMHCA are controlling over a memorandum of understanding, except as specified. \n\nNotwithstanding these PEMHCA provisions, existing law authorizes the City of San Gabriel to agree with its employees, as specified, that the employer contribution for postretirement health care coverage shall be subject to specified conditions, including, among other things, a collectively bargained memorandum of understanding and a minimum level for employer contributions, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, similarly, authorize the City of Indio to enter into an agreement with certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2025 to provide employer contributions for postretirement health care coverage, subject to specified conditions, including, among other things, a collectively bargained memorandum of understanding and a minimum level for employer contributions, as specified. The bill would invalidate an agreement if it provides an employer contribution to employees with less than 5 years of credited service with the City of Indio. The bill would apply only to employees who retire after the date that a memorandum of understanding authorizing this benefit becomes effective. The bill would require the City of Indio to provide notification, as prescribed, of the agreement and any additional information necessary to implement those benefits.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Indio."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
