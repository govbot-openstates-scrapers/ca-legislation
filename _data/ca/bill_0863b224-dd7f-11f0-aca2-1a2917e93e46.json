The OES is under the supervision of the Director of Emergency Services. During a state of war emergency, a state of emergency, or a local emergency, existing law requires the director to coordinate the emergency activities of all state agencies in connection with that emergency.\n\nThis bill would require certain state agencies to establish a nonprofit liaison for nonprofit organizations to contact during a state of emergency. The bill would require the nonprofit liaison to coordinate with state entities and local agencies to provide resources and information to nonprofit organizations during state of emergency relief efforts and support nonprofit organization efforts for increased access to available grants during state of emergency response periods. The bill would require the nonprofit liaison role to be combined with existing roles in the state agency."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Williamson Act: agricultural preserves."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
