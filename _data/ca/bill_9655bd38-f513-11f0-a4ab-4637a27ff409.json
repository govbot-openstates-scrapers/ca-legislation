The act regulates the placement of an off-premises advertising display along highways that generally advertises business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold at a location other than the property where the display is located. The act does not apply to an on-premises advertising display, which generally advertises business conducted, services rendered, or goods produced or sold at the location where the display is located. However, the act authorizes an off-premises advertising display developed as part of and within the boundary limits of a redevelopment agency project, as those boundaries existed on December 29, 2011, to continue to exist and be considered an on-premises display if it meets certain criteria, and authorizes such a display to remain until January 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would extend by 3 years, until January 1, 2029, the authorization to remain for an off-premises advertising display developed as part of and within the boundary limits of a redevelopment agency project, as described above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
