Any voter may apply to the county elections official for appointment as a precinct board member.\n\nThis bill would authorize a county elections official, for each election, to adopt a system in which individuals are randomly selected to serve as precinct board members. The bill would make every citizen who resides in the jurisdiction and is at least 18 years of age eligible to be selected, but would authorize an eligible person to be excused for undue hardship upon themselves or the public."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
