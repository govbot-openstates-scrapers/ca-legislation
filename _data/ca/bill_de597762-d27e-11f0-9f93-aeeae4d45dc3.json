The Sales and Use Tax Law provides various exemptions from those taxes, including a partial exemption from those taxes, on and after July 1, 2014, and before July 1, 2030, for the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, among other things, qualified tangible personal property purchased by a qualified person for purchases not exceeding $200,000,000, for use primarily in manufacturing, processing, refining, fabricating, or recycling of tangible personal property, as specified. Existing law requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to provide a report to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the Department of Finance of, among other things, the total dollar amount of exemptions, as specified. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2031.\n\nThis bill would, instead, extend the above-described partial exemption from those taxes until January 1, 2031, and would remove the above-described reporting requirement pertaining to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The bill would make various conforming changes and repeal these provisions on January 1, 2036.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would require the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, if requested by the Legislature, to submit a report to the Legislature on the exemption and would provide findings and declarations relating to the goals of the exemption.\n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse counties and cities for revenue losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them pursuant to this bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
