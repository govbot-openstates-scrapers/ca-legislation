The act authorizes that state board to include in those regulations the use of a market-based compliance mechanism, known as the California Cap-and-Invest Program, to comply with those regulations. Existing law requires moneys collected by the state board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of the California Cap-and-Invest Program to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and continuously appropriates a portion of the moneys in the fund for various purposes.\n\nExisting law requires the Natural Resources Agency, in collaboration with the state board, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Food and Agriculture, an expert advisory committee established, as provided, and other relevant state agencies, to determine an ambitious range of targets for natural carbon sequestration, and for nature-based climate solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 2030, 2038, and 2045 to support state goals to achieve carbon neutrality and foster climate adaptation and resilience. Existing law defines \"nature-based climate solutions\" for these purposes to mean activities, such as restoration, conservation, and land management actions, that increase net carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in natural and working lands.\n\nThis bill would annually appropriate up to $300,000,000 from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the annual Budget Act each fiscal year from the 2027\u20132028 to the 2045\u201346 fiscal year, inclusive, to achieve nature-based climate solutions, including $150,000,000 to be allocated to the Natural Resources Agency to fund nature-based climate solutions, not less than $50,000,000 to be allocated to the Department of Food and Agriculture to fund nature-based climate solutions in croplands and grasslands, and the remaining amount to be allocated for nature-based climate solutions at the discretion of the Legislature."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
