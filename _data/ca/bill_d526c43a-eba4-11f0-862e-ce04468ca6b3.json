The duties of the board, among others, include establishing standards for local correctional facilities and correctional officers. Under existing law, the board is composed of 15 members, as specified, and 7 members constitutes a quorum.\n\nThis bill would instead require 8 members to constitute a quorum.\n\n(2) Existing law creates within the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation the Prison Industry Authority.\n\nThis bill would rename the Prison Industry Authority as the California Correctional Training and Rehabilitation Authority, would rename the Prison Industry Board as the California Correctional Training and Rehabilitation Board, would rename the Prison Industries Revolving Fund as the California Correctional Training and Rehabilitation Revolving Fund, and would require that any reference to the Prison Industry Authority be deemed a reference to the California Correctional Training and Rehabilitation Authority. \n\n(3) Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over minors who are between 12 and 17 years of age, who have violated a federal, state, or local law or ordinance, as specified, and over minors under 12 years of age who have been alleged to have committed specified crimes. Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to adjudge a person under these circumstances to be a ward of the court. Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to permit a person adjudged a ward of the juvenile court, or placed on probation by the juvenile court, to reside in a county other than their county of legal residence. Existing law authorizes a ward who is permitted to reside in a county other than their county of legal residence to be supervised by the probation officer of the county of actual residence, with the consent of that probation officer.\n\nThis bill would clarify that these provisions apply to wards discharged to probation supervision after having been confined in a secure youth treatment facility, or after having been transferred to a less restrictive program from a secure youth treatment facility.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes any county or court to implement a \"comprehensive collection program\" as a separate revenue collection activity, and requires the program to meet certain criteria, one of which is that the program engages in specified activities in collecting fines or penalties, including, among other things, initiating a driver's license suspension or hold, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete initiating suspensions or holds for driver's licenses from the list of activities in which the program may engage. \n\n(5) Various provisions of the Health and Safety Code, Penal Code, and Welfare and Institutions Code, among others, refer to training and other requirements related to \"deescalation techniques.\" \n\nThis bill would revise all references to \"deescalation\" to \"de-escalation.\"\n\n(6) The bill would also make other technical changes, both conforming and nonsubstantive."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
