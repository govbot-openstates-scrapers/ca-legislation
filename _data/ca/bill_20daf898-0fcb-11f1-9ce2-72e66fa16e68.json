AB 8, beginning January 1, 2028, revises and recasts various provisions in conformity with that prohibition. Among those conforming changes, AB 8 excludes CBD isolate from the definition of \"cannabis concentrate\" for purposes of the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which imposes various penalties for the unlawful possession or sale of cannabis concentrate.\n\nThis bill, beginning on January 1, 2028, would also exclude CBN isolate from that definition of \"cannabis concentrate.\"\n\nThe Cannabis Tax Law authorizes the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration or a law enforcement agency to seize cannabis or cannabis products from a person who possesses, stores, owns, or has made a sale of those cannabis or cannabis products under certain circumstances. AB 8 expanded the seizure authority under the Cannabis Tax Law to include a circumstance in which the product is possessed, stored, offered for sale, or sold by an unlicensed person or at an unlicensed premises, and is presumed to be a cannabis product for containing or purporting to contain a cannabinoid, including a synthetic cannabinoid, as defined.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to the definitional provisions that AB 8 added to the Cannabis Tax Law. Specifically, the bill would delete a redundant definition of synthetic cannabinoid and would delete a definition of CBD isolate, which is a term that is not used in the Cannabis Tax Law provisions.\n\nAB 8 revised the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 (act) to prohibit a person that is engaged in the business of selling cigarettes or tobacco products from possessing, storing, owning, or making a retail sale of cannabis, cannabis products, or a product presumed to be cannabis, and makes a violation of that prohibition subject to a specified fine and license suspension or revocation, as applicable. Existing law requires all moneys collected pursuant to these provisions to be deposited in the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund and makes all moneys in the fund available for expenditure, upon appropriation by the Legislature, solely for the purpose of implementing, enforcing, and administering the act, including the seizure and destruction of cigarettes and tobacco products.\n\nThis bill would revise that funding provision to specify that the purpose of implementing, enforcing, and administering the act includes the seizure and destruction of cannabis, cannabis products, and products presumed to be cannabis."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
