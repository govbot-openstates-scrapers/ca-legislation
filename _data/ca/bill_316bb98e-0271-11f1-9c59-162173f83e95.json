Existing law also requires the governing board of each local publicly owned electric utility with an annual electrical demand exceeding 700 gigawatthours to adopt an integrated resource plan and a process for updating the plan at least once every 5 years to ensure the utility achieves certain goals, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require each electrical corporation, and each local publicly owned utility with an annual electrical demand exceeding 700 gigawatthours, to require the evaluation of surplus interconnection service options and to consider surplus interconnection service options, for purposes of its integrated resource plan.\n\nThis bill would also require each electrical corporation or local publicly owned electric utility to use available grid infrastructure through surplus interconnection service to use any available interconnection capacity, as specified.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause certain provisions of this bill would be part of the act and a violation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nAdditionally, by imposing new duties on local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Electricity: rates."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
