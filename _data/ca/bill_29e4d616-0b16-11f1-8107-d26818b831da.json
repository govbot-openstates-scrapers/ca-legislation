Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts. Under existing law, a violation of the Cartwright Act is punishable as a crime.\n\nThis bill would provide that is unlawful for one or more persons to act, cause, take, or direct a measure, action, or event that is either in restraint of trade, as specified, or to monopolize or monopsonize, as specified. Because the bill would expand the scope of activities punishable as a crime under the Cartwight Act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make related findings and declarations.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Business and Professions Code."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
