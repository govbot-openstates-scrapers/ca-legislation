Existing law also establishes the system of public higher education in this state, including the operation of community colleges.\n\nThis bill, contingent upon an appropriation for its purposes, would require the State Department of Education to, on or before January 1, 2027, develop a deescalation training and make it publicly available on its internet website. The bill would require, commencing in the 2026\u201327 academic year, and annually thereafter, a school district, county office of education, charter school, or community college to, for employees who regularly interact with pupils or students, require training on deescalation techniques designed to minimize the likelihood of pupils or students committing violent acts, as provided. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires an employer, as specified, to establish, implement, and maintain, at all times in all work areas, an effective workplace violence prevention plan containing specified information. Existing law requires the employer to provide effective training to employees on the workplace violence prevention plan, as specified, initially when the plan is first established and annually thereafter.\n\nThis bill would require a workplace violence prevention plan covering employees of a community college district, on or before July 1, 2026, to cover additional education-related topics, as provided, and to be in person and allow for questions to be asked and answered by a natural person in real time. The bill would require the training, as revised under the bill, to occur before a new employee begins their duties and as soon as practicable for existing employees, and then annually for all employees. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
