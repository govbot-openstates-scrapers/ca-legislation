The act requires a tax preparer to register with the California Tax Education Council and, among other things, requires a tax preparer to provide specified written disclosures to a client in connection with tax preparation services. Existing law exempts certain persons from these requirements, including, among others, a person with a current and valid license issued by the California Board of Accountancy.\n\nThis bill would instead exempt an individual with a current and valid license issued by the board, as described above. The bill would additionally exempt an individual who is authorized to practice public accountancy pursuant to specified law and a firm, including the firm's partners, shareholders, owners, or employees, provided the firm has a current and valid license issued by the board.
