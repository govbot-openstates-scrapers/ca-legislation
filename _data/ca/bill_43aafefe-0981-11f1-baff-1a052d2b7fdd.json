Existing federal law, through Disaster SNAP, provides for short-term food assistance benefits to eligible households who are victims of a disaster that disrupts commercial channels of food distribution.\n\n Existing state law requires the State Department of Social Services to identify the necessary elements of a county disaster plan, to issue guidance to county human services agencies, and to offer training on Disaster CalFresh, as specified. Existing law requires the department to maintain updated Disaster CalFresh materials, including, but not limited to, state and county disaster plans, Disaster CalFresh applications, the Disaster CalFresh internet website, and a Disaster CalFresh outreach flyer in all required languages. \n\nThis bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
