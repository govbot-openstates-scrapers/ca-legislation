{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1337", "title": "Information Practices Act of 1977.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["InformationPracticesActof1977"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of requirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined, with regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act counties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal corporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public agencies, as specified.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that exemption for local agencies, and would revise and expand the definition of \"personal information.\" The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of records containing personal information and instruct those persons with respect to specified rules relevant to the act.\n\nThis bill would prohibit an agency from using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes other than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was collected, except as required or authorized by state law.\n\nExisting law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a manner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, except under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of personal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.\n\nExisting law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of any rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of any agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment. \n\nThis bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for discipline. \n\nExisting law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric, or psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the act, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if the wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the individual to whom the information pertains.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in economic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
