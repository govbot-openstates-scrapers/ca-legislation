Existing law requires the surcharge to be based on the Office of Emergency Services' estimate of the number of access lines to which the surcharge will be applied per month for a calendar year period that it estimates, pursuant to a specified formula, will produce sufficient revenue to fund the current fiscal year's 911 and 988 costs. Existing law prohibits the 911 surcharge from exceeding $0.80 per month. \n\nThis bill would instead prohibit the charge from exceeding an unspecified amount per month."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
