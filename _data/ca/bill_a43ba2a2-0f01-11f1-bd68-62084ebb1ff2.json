Existing law establishes 3 tiers of registration based on specified criteria, for periods of at least 10 years, at least 20 years, and life, respectively, for a conviction of specified sex offenses. Existing law authorizes courts that have jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases to suspend the sentence and make and enforce terms of probation in those cases, for a period not to exceed one year, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the court, in an order granting probation, to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and direct the suspension to continue for a period of time not exceeding 2 years, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a court having jurisdiction to impose punishment in misdemeanor cases to suspend the sentence for a period of time not exceeding 3 years for an individual granted probation and ordered to register as a sex offender. This bill would authorize a court granting probation to suspend the imposition or the execution of the sentence for a period of time not exceeding 3 years for an individual granted probation and ordered to register as a sex offender. By extending the term of probation, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
