Existing law defines \"qualified taxpayer\" for the purpose of these exclusions to mean taxpayers that satisfy specified income limitations. \n\nThis bill would amend the above-described exclusions to eliminate the income limitations for taxpayers and to eliminate the $20,000 limitation on income eligible for exclusion.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
