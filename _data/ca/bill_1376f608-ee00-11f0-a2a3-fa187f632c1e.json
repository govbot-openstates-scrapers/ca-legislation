Existing law authorizes only certain individuals to inspect a juvenile case file, including, among others, the county counsel, city attorney, or any other attorney representing the petitioning agency in a dependency action.\n\nThis bill would delete that authority and instead specify that the county counsel, city attorney, or any other attorney representing the county child welfare agency in dependency proceedings, and the county counsel or city attorney representing the child welfare agency or probation department in connection with the administration or review of child welfare or probation services, as specified, may access juvenile case files. The bill would also authorize an attorney representing a party in a civil proceeding, as defined, filed by, or on behalf of, the person who is the subject of the juvenile case file in which the defendant is either the child welfare agency, probation department, or an employee of those entities to inspect and receive copies of a juvenile case file for use in the civil proceeding, as specified. The bill would additionally authorize an attorney representing a person who is or was the subject of juvenile proceedings under specified provisions to access juvenile case files. By imposing additional duties on local entities to provide access to these records, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
