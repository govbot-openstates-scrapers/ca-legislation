Existing law requires, during any state of war emergency, or state of emergency when the need arises for outside aid in any county, city and county, or city, aid to be rendered in accordance with approved emergency plans. In periods other than a state of war emergency, a state of emergency, or a local emergency, existing law authorizes state agencies and political subdivisions to exercise mutual aid powers in accordance with the Master Mutual Aid Agreement and local ordinances, resolutions, agreements, or plans.
