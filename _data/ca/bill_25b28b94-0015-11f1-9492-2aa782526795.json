Existing law requires a school district that has entered into an interdistrict attendance agreement to post the procedures and timelines regarding a request for an interdistrict transfer permit on the school district's internet website.\n\nThis bill would require a school district to maintain a record of all requests for interdistrict transfer and records of the disposition of those requests, as provided. The bill would require a school district to, on or before June 30 of each year, submit the information described above for the current school year to the Superintendent. The bill would require the Superintendent to, on or before August 1 of each year, post the information submitted for the current school year on the department's internet website. By imposing new duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
