Under the act, the authority is authorized to issue revenue bonds to provide the funds for achieving these purposes. Existing law appropriates $40,000,000 to provide cashflow loans to nondesignated public hospitals, as needed, due to the financial impacts of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Existing law requires the nondesignated public hospitals participating in this loan program to repay and discharge the loan within 24 months of the date of the loan.\n\nThis bill would extend the repayment requirements for nondesignated public hospitals participating in the loan program that had received a loan approval from, and entered into a loan and security agreement with, the authority by requiring those hospitals to begin monthly repayments on the loan 32 months after the date of the loan, and discharge the loan within 60 months of the date of the loan, as prescribed. The bill would require the monthly payments to be amortized over the term of the loan, at 0% interest. By removing restrictions limiting the expenditure of moneys appropriated for purposes of these loans, the bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Short-term residential therapeutic program: requirements."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
