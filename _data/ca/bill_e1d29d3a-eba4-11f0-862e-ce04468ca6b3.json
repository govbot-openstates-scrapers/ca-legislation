Existing law requires a baccalaureate degree program offered by a community college district to (1) be offered in a subject area with unmet workforce needs in the local community or region of the district, (2) not offer a program or program curricula already offered by the California State University or University of California, and (3) have the expertise, resources, and student interest to offer a quality baccalaureate degree in the chosen field of study. If, during the consultation process related to a proposed baccalaureate degree program, the California State University or the University of California believes there is program duplication and the applicable segment submits written objections, existing law requires the objecting segment and the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to establish a written agreement before the program is approved, as provided.\n\nThis bill would authorize the board of governors to approve a baccalaureate degree program at Allan Hancock College without a written agreement between the objecting segment and the chancellor if the board of governors determines the proposed baccalaureate degree program satisfies the baccalaureate degree program requirements described above.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Allan Hancock College."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
