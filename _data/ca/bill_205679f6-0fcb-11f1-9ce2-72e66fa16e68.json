Existing law requires the conservancy to prepare and adopt a strategic plan to achieve the goals of the conservancy and requires the strategic plan to be consistent with certain plans. Existing law authorizes the conservancy to engage in partnerships with nonprofit organizations, local public agencies, and landowners, and authorizes the conservancy to provide grants and loans to state agencies, local public agencies, and nonprofit organizations to further the goals of the conservancy.
