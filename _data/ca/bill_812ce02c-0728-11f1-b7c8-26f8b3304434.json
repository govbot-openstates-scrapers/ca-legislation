Existing law requires a covered provider to offer the user the option to include a certain manifest disclosure in image, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof, created or altered by the covered provider's generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) system and requires a covered provider to include a certain latent disclosure in AI-generated image, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof, created by the covered provider's GenAI system. Existing law defines \"covered provider\" for these purposes to mean a person that creates, codes, or otherwise produces a generative AI system that has over 1,000,000 monthly visitors or users and is publicly accessible within the geographic boundaries of the state.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, among other changes, delete the user threshold from the definition of \"covered provider,\" replace the term \"AI detection tool\" with \"disclosure verification tool,\" delete the above-described requirement of a covered provider to offer the user the option to include a manifest disclosure in content, and additionally require a covered provider to include in the above-described latent disclosure whether the content is generated or modified by artificial intelligence.\n\nThis bill would also exempt from those provisions a product, service, or application that is primarily marketed and intended to facilitate accessibility for disabled individuals and is designed to prevent content generated by the product, service, internet website, or application from being downloaded, stored, or otherwise appropriated, to the extent technically feasible.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
