{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB1201", "title": "CalFresh: veteran eligibility.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["CalFresh", "veteraneligibility"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing federal law provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) , known in California as CalFresh, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Existing federal law establishes eligibility requirements, including specified income eligibility standards, for receipt of CalFresh benefits.\n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Social Services, on or before April 1, 2027, to submit a request to the United States Department of Agriculture for a waiver to exclude the costs incurred by a veteran associated with the veteran's job search from countable income in the determination of eligibility and benefit level for receiving CalFresh benefits, and to exempt specified veterans from the time limit and associated work requirements. The bill would require the waivers to be implemented within 6 months from their approval. To the extent the bill would expand the duties of counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training (CalFresh E&T) program, established by federal law, to provide work experience or training and job search training to CalFresh recipients. Existing law requires, in a county that elects to participate in the program, that a veteran applying for CalFresh benefits who is required to register to work, but who is exempt from mandatory placement in the CalFresh E&T program, be provided with specified referrals to veterans' assistance and job training agencies if those agencies are known to the county.\n\nThis bill would require a county to provide those referrals to veterans' assistance and job training agencies whether or not the veteran applying for CalFresh benefits is exempt from mandatory placement in the CalFresh E&T program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
