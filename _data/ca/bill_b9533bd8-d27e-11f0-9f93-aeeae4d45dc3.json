{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB623", "title": "Property taxation: homeowners', veterans', and disabled veterans' exemptions.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Propertytaxation", "homeowners',veterans',anddisabledveterans'exemptions"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "The California Constitution declares that all property is taxable and establishes or authorizes various exemptions from tax for real property, including a homeowners' exemption in the amount of $7,000 of the full value of a dwelling that may be applied unless the dwelling receives another real property exemption. The California Constitution and existing property tax law establish a veterans' exemption in the amount of $4,000, as specified, for a veteran who meets certain military service requirements, and generally exempts from property taxation the same value of property of a deceased veteran's unmarried spouse and parents. The California Constitution and existing property tax law establish a disabled veterans' exemption in the amount of $100,000 or $150,000 for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran's spouse, as specified.\n\nExisting property tax law establishing the homeowners' exemption specifies that the exemption may not be applied to a property on which the owner receives the veterans' exemption.\n\nThis bill would provide that if Senate Constitutional Amendment ____ is approved by the voters at the statewide general election scheduled for November 3, 2026, then commencing January 1, 2025, notwithstanding that prohibition, the homeowners' exemption also applies to property on which an owner receives the veterans' exemption or the disabled veterans' exemption. By imposing additional duties on local tax officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.\n\nExisting law contains provisions related to elections and voting, including a requirement that a constitutional amendment submitted to the people by the Legislature appear on the ballot of the first statewide election occurring at least 131 days after the adoption of the proposal by the Legislature and that the Secretary of State mail state voter information guides to voters.\n\nThis bill would require the Secretary of State, notwithstanding specified provisions of existing law relating to elections and voting, to submit Senate Constitutional Amendment ____ of the 2025\u201326 Regular Session to the voters for their approval at the statewide general election scheduled for November 3, 2026."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
