Existing law requires access to those particular records relevant to the legitimate educational interests of the pupil to, among other individuals, a pupil 14 years of age or older who is both a homeless child or youth, as defined, and an unaccompanied youth, as defined.\n\nThis bill would additionally require access to those particular records relevant to the legitimate educational interests of the pupil to a pupil 14 years of age or older who is a foster youth, as defined. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on school districts related to pupil record requests, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
