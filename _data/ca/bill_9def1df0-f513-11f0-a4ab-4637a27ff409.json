Existing law creates a Research Advisory Panel, as specified, to conduct hearings on, and in other ways study, research projects concerning controlled substances. Existing law authorizes the panel to approve research projects that have been registered with the Attorney General concerning the nature and effects of cannabis or hallucinogenic drugs and the treatment of abuse of controlled substances. Existing law authorizes a person who, under federal law, is entitled to use controlled substances for the purpose of research, instruction, or analysis, to lawfully obtain and use those controlled substances upon approval by the panel, as specified.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast these provisions to require the panel to review research projects to be conducted in this state that require the administration of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances. The bill would authorize the panel, until January 1, 2028, to expedite the review of projects that satisfy certain criteria, including, among others things, that have sought or received certain federal approvals and have proof of independent peer review of the study, as described. The bill would authorize the chairperson of the panel to deputize 2 or more panel members to review the research project and to approve it, without a vote by the entire panel. The bill would authorize the panel to withdraw its approval for reasonable cause and would require the panel to provide notice and time for the concern to be cured by the project before withdrawing its approval.\n\nExisting law, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a state body be open and public and all persons be permitted to attend. Existing law, until January 1, 2027, authorizes the Research Advisory Panel to hold closed sessions for the purpose of discussing, reviewing, and approving research projects that contain sensitive and confidential information, including trade secrets, intellectual property, or proprietary information in its possession, the public disclosure of which is prohibited by law.\n\nThis bill would extend the authorization to hold closed sessions to January 1, 2028, and would additionally exempt the above-described panel members assigned to review and approve a research project from the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act until January 1, 2028.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
