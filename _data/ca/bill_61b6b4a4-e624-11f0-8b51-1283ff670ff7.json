{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB501", "title": "Household Hazardous Waste Producer Responsibility Act.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["HouseholdHazardousWasteProducerResponsibilityAct"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Under existing law, as part of the hazardous waste control laws, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) generally regulates the management and handling of hazardous waste and hazardous materials. Existing law authorizes a public agency, as defined, to operate a household hazardous waste collection facility under permit from DTSC.\n\nExisting law, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, establishes a producer responsibility program designed to ensure that producers of single-use packaging and food service ware covered by that program take responsibility for the costs associated with the end-of-life management of that material and ensure that the material is recyclable or compostable.\n\nThis bill would create a producer responsibility program for products containing household hazardous waste and would require a producer responsibility organization (PRO) to ensure the safe and convenient collection and management of covered products at no cost to consumers or local governments. The bill would define \"covered product\" to mean a consumer product that is ignitable, toxic, corrosive, or reactive, or that meets other specified criteria, except as specified. The bill would require a producer of a covered product to register with the PRO, which would be required to develop and implement a producer responsibility plan for the collection, transportation, and the safe and proper management of covered products. The bill would require DTSC to adopt regulations to implement the program with an effective date no earlier than July 1, 2028.\n\nThis bill would require the PRO, within 12 months of the effective date of the regulations, to submit a producer responsibility plan to DTSC. The bill would require the plan to include specified elements, including a funding mechanism to fully fund the PRO and the program. The bill would require, within 6 months of receipt of the plan, DTSC to approve, approve in part, or disapprove the plan, as specified. The bill would require DTSC to notify the PRO of its decision. If DTSC does not approve the plan in full, then the bill would require DTSC to specify the reasons for disapproval or identify the portions of the partially approved plan that do not comply with the program, as applicable. The bill would require the PRO to submit a revised plan if its plan is not fully approved. The bill would conditionally approve a plan if DTSC does not approve, approve in part, or disapprove a plan within one year of receipt of the plan.\n\nThis bill would require the PRO to implement its plan within 90 days of approval. The bill would require the plan to be fully funded in a manner that equitably distributes the plan's costs among participant producers, as specified. The bill would require the PRO to reimburse local jurisdictions for costs associated with collecting illegally dumped covered products and for providing a convenient collection system for covered products if the PRO's plan relies on local jurisdictions to collect or manage covered products.\n\nThis bill would require the PRO to prepare and submit to DTSC an annual report describing the activities carried out pursuant to the plan. The bill would require the PRO to retain specified documents, annually audit its accounting books, and make documents available to DTSC for review, as specified. The bill would require all reports and records provided to DTSC pursuant to the program to be provided under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require a participant producer, through the PRO, to pay DTSC, on an unspecified schedule, an annual administrative charge, as determined by DTSC. The bill would require the charge be set at an amount that is adequate to cover DTSC's full costs of administering and enforcing the program. The bill would provide for the imposition of administrative civil penalties on producers and other specified persons who violate the program. The bill would establish the Household Hazardous Waste Producer Responsibility Fund in the State Treasury and would require the administrative charges collected by DTSC to be deposited into that fund for expenditure by DTSC, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to cover DTSC's cost to implement the program. The bill would also establish the Household Hazardous Waste Products Penalty Account in the Household Hazardous Waste Producer Responsibility Fund and would require that the civil penalties collected by DTSC pursuant to the program be deposited into that account, for expenditure by DTSC, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for activities related to the collection, reuse, and recycling of covered products, grants for related purposes, and the administration and enforcement of the program.\n\nThis bill would require the PRO to prepare an initial statewide needs assessment designed to determine the necessary steps and investments needed for covered products to achieve the requirements and purposes of the program, as specified. The bill would provide that certain actions of the PRO or a producer are not violations of the Cartwright Act or certain provisions regulating unfair business practices or unfair competition.\n\n(2) Existing law established the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) to, among other things, promote waste management in the order of source reduction, then recycling and composting, and then environmentally safe transformation and environmentally safe land disposal, as provided. Pursuant to that authority, CalRecycle publishes various waste characterization studies.\n\nThis bill would require CalRecycle, in support of the program, to include in updates to the applicable waste characterization study the amount of covered products that were properly and improperly disposed of, as specified.\n\n(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
