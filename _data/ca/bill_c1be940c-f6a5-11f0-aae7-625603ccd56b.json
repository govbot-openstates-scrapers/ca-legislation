{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1037", "title": "Public health: substance use disorder.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Publichealth", "substanceusedisorder"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Under existing law, a licensed health care provider who is authorized by law to prescribe an opioid antagonist may issue standing orders for the distribution of an opioid antagonist to a person at risk of an opioid-related overdose or to a family member, friend, or other person in a position to assist a person at risk of an opioid-related overdose. Existing law exempts a health care provider who acts with reasonable care in issuing a prescription or order for an opioid antagonist from professional review, civil action, or criminal prosecution, under certain circumstances. Existing law requires that a person who receives an opioid antagonist pursuant to a standing order or otherwise possesses an opioid antagonist receive training, as specified. Existing law provides that a person who is trained in the use of an opioid antagonist and acts with reasonable care and in good faith is not subject to professional review, liable in a civil action, or subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nThis bill would expand the above-described authorizations to those who are at risk of or any person who may be in a position to assist a person experiencing any overdose and would strike the requirement that those who receive and possess opioid antagonists receive training. The bill would authorize a person in a position to assist a person at risk of an overdose to possess an opioid antagonist and subsequently dispense or distribute an opioid antagonist to a person at risk of an overdose or another person in a position to assist a person at risk of an overdose. The bill would instead exempt a person who administers an opioid antagonist in good faith, whether or not they were trained, from liability for civil damages, as specified, and would instead exempt a health care provider who acts with reasonable care from liability in a civil action for any injuries or damages relating to or resulting from the acts or omissions of any person who administers the opioid antagonist in good faith, as specified.\n\n(2) Existing law imposes a drug program fee for each separate controlled substance offense, as specified, to be deposited by the county treasurer in a drug program fund. Existing law requires that a portion of the fund be allocated to primary prevention programs in the community.\n\nThis bill would state that primary prevention programs may include those activities aligned with evidence-based best practices, as specified.\n\n(3) Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to license and regulate facilities that provide residential nonmedical services to adults who are recovering from problems related to alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug misuse or abuse, and who need alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug recovery treatment or detoxification services. Existing law authorizes a licensed alcohol or other drug recovery or treatment facility to permit incidental medical services, as defined, to be provided to a resident at the facility premises by a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner under specified limited circumstances, including that the resident has signed an admission agreement. Existing law requires a licensee to develop a plan to address when a resident relapses, including when a resident is on the licensed premises after consuming alcohol or using illicit drugs.\n\nThis bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2027, to offer a combined application for entities seeking licensure as an alcohol or other drug recovery or treatment facility and to provide incidental medical services, as defined. The bill would prohibit the department from requiring an admission agreement to require a person to be abstinent and not intoxicated in order to be admitted to care or continue treatment. The bill would require a licensee to prioritize the individual maintaining some level of connection to treatment, following a relapse.\n\n(4) Existing law defines \"drug- or alcohol-related program\" as any program designed to reduce the unlawful use of, or assist those who engage in the unlawful use of, drugs or alcohol, through various means, such as intervention, treatment, and enforcement, among others. Existing law prohibits the encumbrance of state funds for a drug- or alcohol-related program unless it contains a component that explains that there is no unlawful use of drugs or alcohol and requires all aspects of a drug- or alcohol-related program receiving state funds to be consistent with the \"no lawful use\" message.\n\nThis bill would redefine that term to mean any program designed to assist persons with substance use disorders and would strike enforcement from the specified means. The bill would repeal the above-described provisions related to the \"no lawful use\" message."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
