The act requires all public schools, health facilities operated by the state or a political subdivision of the state, and courthouses to implement the model policy, or an equivalent policy.\n\nThis bill would require the Attorney General, on or before October 30, 2027, and annually thereafter, to submit to the Legislature and the Governor, and post on its internet website, a report that includes, among other things, a summary of all immigration incidents and activities conducted by any person at designated safe locations that have reported immigration incidents and activities either onsite or to the Attorney General. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to request representatives of the designated safe locations to furnish any reported immigration incidents and activities as part of compiling its annual report, and would authorize the Attorney General to issue civil penalties or conduct other enforcement activity to ensure compliance with these provisions. The bill would define \"designated safe locations\" to mean educational institutions, health care providers, shelters, polling places, courthouses, public transportation property, state and local government property, and areas where the public may be exercising their rights protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To the extent the bill would impose duties on locals, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
