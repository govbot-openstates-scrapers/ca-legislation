The act classifies the mountain lion as a specially protected mammal under the laws of this state, and makes it unlawful to take, injure, possess, transport, import, or sell any mountain lion or any part or product thereof. The act authorizes the take of mountain lions under limited circumstances, including by authorizing the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or an appropriate local agency authorized by the department, to remove or take any mountain lion that is perceived to be an imminent threat to public health or safety. Existing law permits the department, as the department determines is necessary to protect mountain lions or the public, to authorize qualified individuals, educational institutions, governmental agencies, or nongovernmental organizations to implement nonlethal procedures, which are defined as procedures that may include, among other things, capturing, pursuing, or hazing mountain lions. Existing law permits the department to authorize qualified individuals, educational institutions, governmental agencies, or nongovernmental organizations to conduct scientific research involving mountain lions pursuant to a scientific collecting permit, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to maintain, enhance, and expand its human-mountain lion conflicts program in order to protect public health and safety, including by exercising its authority to authorize nonlethal procedures. The bill would require the department to continue and expand its scientific research effort to develop and evaluate methods to deter mountain lions from entering communities and to prevent habituation to humans. In implementing these programs, the bill would require the department to engage in specified public outreach activities. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2033.\n\nThe bill would require the department to prepare and submit a report to the Legislature on or before October 1, 2031, describing these programs, the results of the programs, the number of department personnel involved in the programs, and recommendations to further improve the programs to protect human health and safety. The bill would require the Director of Fish and Wildlife, until the 2034 calendar year, to appear on an annual basis at a hearing before one of specified committees of the Legislature to provide a status update on the programs.\n\nThe California Wildlife Protection Act of 1990 prohibits the Legislature from changing the act, with specified exceptions, except by a 45 vote of the membership of both houses of the Legislature and then only if consistent with, and in furtherance of, the purposes of the act.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is consistent with, and furthers the purposes of, that act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
