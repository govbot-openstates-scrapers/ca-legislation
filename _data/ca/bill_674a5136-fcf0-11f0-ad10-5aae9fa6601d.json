Existing law defines various terms for these purposes. Existing law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to oversee compliance with those provisions, authorizes a local government to enact an ordinance to make its zoning code consistent with those provisions, as specified, and requires each metropolitan planning organization to create a map of transit-oriented development stops and zones within its region by tier, as specified. \n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation that would make technical and clarifying changes to those laws governing transit-oriented development, and to add a select set of San Francisco Bay area ferry terminals to the scope of those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
