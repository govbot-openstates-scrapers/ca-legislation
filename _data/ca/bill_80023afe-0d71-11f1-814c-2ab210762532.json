Existing law requires the system to support local educational agencies in their efforts to identify and support pupils at risk of dropping out, and requires the system to be capable of issuing periodic reports to local educational agencies that include school district, school, class, and individual pupil reports on the rates of absence and chronic absentees, as defined.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
