The act requires the board to consist of 9 members, appointed by the Governor, Speaker of the Assembly, or the Senate Committee on Rules, as specified, and requires each member of the board be appointed to a 4-year term.\n\nThis bill would specify that the 4-year term expires 4 years after the date of the appointment. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes to the provisions specifying the appointment authorities for the board members.\n\n The Naturopathic Doctors Act authorizes the board to grant a license to an applicant who meets specified requirements, but who graduated before 1986, and passed a state or Canadian Province naturopathic licensing examination, as specified. The act requires that applications under this provision be received no later than December 31, 2007.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
