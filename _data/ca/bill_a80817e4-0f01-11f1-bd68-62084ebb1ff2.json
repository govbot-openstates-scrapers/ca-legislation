A person upon whom the duty of interment is imposed by law who omits to perform that duty within a reasonable period of time is guilty of a misdemeanor. If a person has been charged with first- or second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter in connection with the decedent's death and those charges are known to the funeral director or cemetery authority, existing law passes the right of control to the next of kin in accordance with the aforementioned priority. \n\nThis bill, Marissa's Law, would pass the right of control to the next of kin in accordance with the aforementioned priority if a funeral director or cemetery authority knows that the person with right of control (1) has been subject to a restraining order for domestic violence against the deceased or against the custodial parent of the deceased, (2) is a parent of the deceased and their custody or visitation rights were terminated or suspended, or (3) is a parent of the deceased and granting disposition rights to the person would be contrary to the decedent's best interests or the wishes of the custodial parent of the deceased."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
