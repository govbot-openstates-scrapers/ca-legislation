The Sales and Use Tax Law provides various exemptions from those taxes. \n\nThis bill would, on and after January 1, 2027, and before January 1, 2032, provide an exemption from the taxes imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law for the gross receipts of a qualified backup electricity generator, as defined, during the month of May, as specified. The bill would restrict the exemption to apply only to those generators with a cost not exceeding $7,000 and purchased for noncommercial purposes.\n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws. \n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by the bill does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes. \n\nExisting law imposes or dedicates certain state sales and use tax rates for local funding, including through the Local Revenue Fund 2011. \n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by the bill does not apply to those state sales and use tax rates imposed or dedicated for local government funding, including those rates for which revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011. \n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Generators: air pollution regulations: income tax credits."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
