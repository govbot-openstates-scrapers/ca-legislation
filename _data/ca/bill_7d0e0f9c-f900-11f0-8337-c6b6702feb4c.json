The department, pursuant to the requirement of developing the California School Dashboard, has included as one of several state indicators, the College/Career Indicator (CCI) , which represents the percentage of high school graduates who are prepared for college or a career.\n\nThis bill would require the state board to, upon the next revision of the California School Dashboard, consider for inclusion, for purposes of the CCI, the percentage of pupils who intend to enroll in college and the percentage of pupils who intend to enter or be employed through a registered apprenticeship program, skilled trade, or industry-aligned career pathway, as provided.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the governing board of each county board of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and to update its LCAP before July 1 of each year. Existing law requires an LCAP to include, among other things, a description of the annual goals to be achieved for each state priority, as specified, for all pupils and certain subgroups of pupils. The state's delineated priorities include, among others, school climate, as measured by, pupil suspension rates, pupil expulsion rates, and other local measures, including surveys of pupils, parents, and teachers on the sense of safety and school connectedness.\n\nThis bill would add as a local measurement for determining school climate, for purposes of the LCAP adopted and updated by each county board of education, the percentage of pupils who intend to enroll in college and the percentage of pupils who intend to enter or be employed through a registered apprenticeship program, skilled trade, or industry-aligned career pathway, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies or local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
