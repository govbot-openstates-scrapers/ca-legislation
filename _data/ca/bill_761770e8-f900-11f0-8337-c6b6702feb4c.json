Existing law requires the Secretary of State to create an internet website or to use other available technology to consolidate information about each state ballot measure, including a list of the top 10 contributors supporting or opposing a measure, if compiled by the Fair Political Practices Commission.\n\nThis bill would require the 3 largest contributors of $100,000 or more to all committees that paid for the circulation of a statewide initiative or statewide referendum measure to also be printed on the ballot immediately following the names of the measure's supporters and opponents. The Secretary of State would be required to make a copy of the top contributors available for public examination prior to printing that information on ballots, and voters would be authorized to seek a writ of mandate requiring the identified contributors to be amended or deleted. The bill would specify words and phrases that may be left out of a top contributor's name in order to shorten the name when printed on the ballot.\n\nThe bill would apply its provisions only to proposed statewide initiative or statewide referendum measures for which the Attorney General delivers a circulating title and summary to the proponents on or after January 1, 2026. To the extent the bill would increase the duties of county elections officials relative to examining initiative and referendum petitions and printing ballots, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Occupational safety: face coverings."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
