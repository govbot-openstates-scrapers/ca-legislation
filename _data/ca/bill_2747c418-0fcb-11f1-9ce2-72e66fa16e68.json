Existing law authorizes a social worker to commence proceedings in the juvenile court to declare a child to be a dependent child of the court by the filing of a petition with the court. In any case in which a social worker, after investigation of an application for petition or other investigation, determines that a child is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or will probably soon be within the jurisdiction, existing law authorizes the social worker, in lieu of filing a petition or subsequent to dismissal of a petition already filed, and with the consent of the child's parent or guardian, to undertake a program of supervision of the child.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
