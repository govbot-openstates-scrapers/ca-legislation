Each qualified political party is required to notify the Secretary of State of the names of the party's nominees for President and Vice President on or before the 75th day before a presidential general election, and the Secretary of State is required to place the names of those nominees upon the ballot for the election.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the Secretary of State from placing the name of any candidate for the office of President or Vice President upon the ballot, if the candidate does not affirm, under oath, that the candidate will fully meet the qualifications of the office. Because a person who willfully makes a false statement under oath is guilty of the crime of perjury, this bill expands the scope of that crime and thereby creates a state-mandated local program. If the Secretary of State has reasonable suspicion based on articulable fact that a candidate for President or Vice President does not meet the qualifications for office, the bill would authorize the Secretary of State to investigate the candidate's qualifications and request proof of the candidate's constitutional eligibility to hold the office.\n\nThe bill would authorize an elector to challenge the qualifications of a candidate for President or Vice President by filing a petition in the Superior Court of the County of Sacramento, and it would authorize a candidate who is not certified by the Secretary of State for failure to meet the qualifications of office to challenge the Secretary of State's determination by filing a petition in the same court. The bill would require the petition to be filed no later than 5 days after the date on which the Secretary of State issues the certified list of candidates for the election. The bill would require the court to hold a hearing no more than 10 days after the Secretary of State issues the certified list of candidates and to issue a decision no more than 48 hours after the hearing.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Evidence: admissibility: writings."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
