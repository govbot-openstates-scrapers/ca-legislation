Existing law prescribes various powers and duties to the Franchise Tax Board, including, among other things, the administration of state personal income taxes and corporation franchise and income taxes.\n\nThe Personal Income Tax Law, in conformity with federal income tax laws, defines \"gross income\" as income from whatever source derived, except as specifically excluded, and provides various exclusions from income, including, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before January 1, 2030, an exclusion from income for any qualified taxpayer, as defined, for amounts received in settlement in connection with a wildfire in the state, as provided.\n\nThis bill would amend the definitions provided in that exclusion from tax and would limit the exclusion to qualified amounts made in connection with a qualified wildfire disaster, as defined.\n\nThis bill would also appropriate $10,000 from the General Fund to the Franchise Tax Board to administer qualified wildfire disaster settlements, as specified.\n\nThis bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 23 of the membership of each house of the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
