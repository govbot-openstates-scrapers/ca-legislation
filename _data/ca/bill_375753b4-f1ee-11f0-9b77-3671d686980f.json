Existing law also authorizes moneys in the GDTF to be used for the expansion of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include cystic fibrosis, biotinidase, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) , adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) , and any other disease that is detectable in blood samples, as specified, and exempts the expansion of contracts for this purpose from certain provisions of the Public Contract Code, the Government Code, and the State Administrative Manual, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for Duchenne muscular dystrophy as soon as possible, but no later than January 1, 2027. By expanding the purposes for which moneys from the GDTF may be expended, this bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
