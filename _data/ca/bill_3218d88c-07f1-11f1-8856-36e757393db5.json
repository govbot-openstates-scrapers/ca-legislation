Existing law requires an applicant for a license to act as a bail agent to file with the commissioner a notice of appointment executed by a surety insurer or its authorized representative authorizing that applicant to execute undertakings of bail and to solicit and negotiate those undertakings on its behalf. Existing law similarly requires an applicant for a bail fugitive recovery agent's license to file with the commissioner a notice of appointment executed by a bail agent or surety insurer authorizing that applicant to act on behalf of, and pursuant to, the instructions of the appointing licenseholder. Existing law authorizes these notices of appointment to continue in force until the termination of the agent's license, the end of the license term, or the filing of a notice of termination, as specified.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
