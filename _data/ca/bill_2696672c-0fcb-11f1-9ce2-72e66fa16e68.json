Existing law requires recipients of a financial incentive awarded pursuant to the program to be a California-headquartered company for the entire term of the financial incentive and for 10 years after the financial incentive ends.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that latter provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
