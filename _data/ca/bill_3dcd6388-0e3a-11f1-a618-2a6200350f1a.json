The bill would require the state board to submit data to the relevant policy committees of the Legislature that demonstrates how a proposed regulation is compliant with this prohibition. \n\nExisting law, the Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act, establishes the South Coast Air Quality Management District in those portions of the Counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino included within the South Coast Air Basin as the local agency with the responsibility for comprehensive air pollution control within the basin. \n\nThis bill would prohibit the south coast district from adopting any regulation or rule that would add more than $0.02 to the cost of a gallon of gasoline, add $2,000 or more to the cost to build any home, or add $5,000 or more to the cost to build a nonresidential building. The bill would require the south coast district to submit data to the relevant policy committees of the Legislature that demonstrates how a proposed regulation is compliant with this prohibition. To the extent it would impose additional duties on a local entity, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
