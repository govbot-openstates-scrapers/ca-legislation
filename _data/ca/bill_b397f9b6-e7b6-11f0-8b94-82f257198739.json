Existing law authorizes a community college district to admit to any community college under its jurisdiction as a special part-time or full-time student a pupil who is eligible to attend community college under these provisions.\n\nThis bill would require, commencing with the 2029\u201330 academic year, a local educational agency serving high school pupils that does not have an existing dual enrollment program to establish a dual enrollment program through a formal partnership or agreement with the governing board of a community college district, as provided. The bill would require a local educational agency that does not have an existing dual enrollment program to establish a formal partnership through a College and Career Access Pathways partnership or an early or middle college high school, as specified. The bill would require courses offered through a dual enrollment program pursuant to these provisions to lead to a degree, credential, certificate, or transfer. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies and community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
