{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB775", "title": "Board of Psychology and Board of Behavioral Sciences.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["BoardofPsychologyandBoardofBehavioralSciences"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law, the Psychology Licensing Law, establishes the Board of Psychology to license and regulate psychologists and the practice of psychology. Existing law repeals the provision establishing the board on January 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would extend operation of the board to January 1, 2030.\n\nExisting law authorizes a person who is licensed as a psychologist at the doctoral level in another state or territory of the United States or Canada to offer psychological services in this state for up to 30 days per year. Existing law authorizes a person other than a licensed psychologist to perform psychological functions in preparation for licensure as a psychologist if the person is registered with the board as a registered psychological associate, and establishes requirements in that regard.\n\nThis bill would require an out-of-state licensee to satisfy certain conditions to offer psychological services, including informing the client of the limited timeframe of the services and that the person is not licensed in California. The bill would require an applicant for registration as a psychological associate who was trained in an educational institution outside the United States or Canada to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the applicant possesses a doctoral degree in psychology or education that is equivalent to a degree earned from a regionally accredited academic institution in the United States or Canada, as specified.\n\nExisting law establishes qualifications for registration as a psychological testing technician, including proof of completion of a bachelor's degree or graduate degree, or proof of current enrollment in a graduate degree program in psychology or in education with a field of specialization in educational psychology, counseling psychology, or school psychology. Existing law also establishes various fees relating to the licensure and regulation of the practice of psychology.\n\nThis bill would expand the list of authorized areas of study for registration as a psychological testing technician to include neuroscience, cognitive science, or behavioral science, and would specify that the board shall make the final determination as to whether a degree or degree program meets the educational requirements. The bill would establish a fee of $25 to add or change a supervisor for a psychological testing technician.\n\nExisting law provides that a psychologist's license shall be suspended automatically during any time the holder of the license is incarcerated after conviction of a felony, and provides for the continued suspension of the license if, after a hearing, it is determined in the hearing that the felony for which the licensee was convicted is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a licensee. Existing law requires any discipline ordered to cease if the conviction is overturned on appeal.\n\n This bill would revise and recast those provisions, including authorizing the board to decline to set aside the suspension when it appears to be in the interest of justice to do so. The bill would revise and recast provisions relating to suspended, revoked, and surrendered licenses and obtaining a new license after a license is void after not being renewed within 3 years. The bill would make various technical and other changes to the Psychology Licensing Law, including defining the term \"client.\"\n\n(2) Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of research psychoanalysts and student research psychoanalysts by the Board of Psychology, and establishes acts for which the board may revoke or suspend registration and that are deemed unprofessional conduct. Existing law establishes fees for registration, which are deposited into the Psychology Fund.\n\nThis bill, among other changes to the provisions regulating research psychoanalysts and student research psychoanalysts, would expand the list of acts constituting unprofessional conduct that would authorize the board to suspend or revoke a registration. The bill would revise education and training requirements for registration as a research psychoanalyst, including requiring an applicant to complete certain coursework or training in detection and treatment of alcohol and other chemical substance dependency, suicide risk assessment and intervention, and aging and long-term care. The bill would establish continuing professional development requirements for research psychoanalysts. The bill would require the board to adopt a program of consumer and professional education in matters relevant to the ethical practice of psychoanalysis. The bill would establish fingerprint hard card processing fees for out-of-state applicants, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires certain behavioral health professionals to complete training in human sexuality and to complete coursework or training in child abuse assessment and reporting, as specified. Existing law provides that the Board of Psychology and the Board of Behavioral Sciences are encouraged to include coursework regarding the assessment and reporting of elder and dependent adult abuse in the required training on aging and long-term care issues before licensure or license renewal. Existing law makes findings and declarations related to the training of certain licensed behavioral health professionals in the areas of child, elder, and dependent adult abuse assessment reporting.\n\nThis bill would include research psychoanalysts in the behavioral health professionals subject to the above-described training requirements and provisions. The bill would make various technical and other changes to the Psychology Licensing Law.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes the Board of Behavioral Sciences in the Department of Consumer Affairs to regulate licensees under the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act, the Educational Psychologist Practice Act, the Clinical Social Worker Practice Act, and the Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Act, and authorizes the board to appoint an executive officer to exercise certain powers and perform specified duties. Existing law repeals the provision establishing the board and authorizing the board to appoint an executive officer on January 1, 2026. Existing law, until January 1, 2026, authorizes a person who holds a license in another jurisdiction of the United States as a marriage and family therapist, a clinical social worker, or a professional clinical counselor to provide those services in this state for a period not to exceed 30 days. Existing law specifies that a person who provides services pursuant to those provisions is deemed to have agreed to practicing under the jurisdiction of the board and to be bound by the laws of this state.\n\nThis bill would extend the date of the operation of the board and of authorizing the board to appoint an executive officer to January 1, 2030, and would extend the date on which the provision authorizing a person who is licensed out-of-state as a marriage and family therapist, a clinical social worker, or professional clinical counselor to practice in this state to January 1, 2030. The bill would deem a person who is licensed in another jurisdiction who provides services to have attested under penalty of perjury to practicing under the jurisdiction of the board and to be bound by the laws of this state. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires a registrant or applicant for licensure as a marriage and family therapist to pass a clinical examination, and establishes a fee of $250, which the board is authorized to increase by regulation to up to $500, for the clinical examination.\n\nThis bill would specify that the clinical examination may be administered either by the board or by a public or private organization, and would revise the fee requirement so that if the examination is administered by a public or private organization, the fee would be paid directly to the organization.\n\nExisting law requires certain applicants for registration or licensure as a marriage and family therapist who completed graduate study on or before December 31, 2018, to submit to the board a certification by the applicant's educational institution that the institution's required curriculum for graduation and associated coursework includes certain instruction in alcoholism and other chemical substance dependency and in spousal or partner abuse assessment, detection, and intervention.\n\nThis bill would delete that requirement.\n\nExisting law requires an applicant for licensure or registration as a professional clinical counselor to obtain a degree in a program that includes a minimum of 280 hours of face-to-face supervised clinical experience counseling individuals, families, or groups. Existing law requires a professional clinical counselor trainee to receive an average of at least one hour of direct supervisor contact for every 5 hours of direct clinical counseling performed each week and specifies that not more than 6 hours of supervision shall be credited during any single week.\n\nThis bill would delete the provision limiting the number of hours of supervision credited in a single week to 6 hours.\n\nExisting law, effective August 29, 2022, until January 1, 2026, revised provisions related to supervision via videoconferencing. In this regard, existing law defines \"face-to-face contact\" for purposes of the definition of \"one hour of direct supervisor contact\" to mean in-person contact, contact via 2-way, real-time videoconferencing, or some combination of these. Existing law requires a supervisor within 60 days of the commencement of supervision to conduct a meeting with the supervisee during which the supervisor is required to assess the appropriateness of allowing the supervisee to receive supervision via 2-way, real-time videoconferencing, as specified, and to document the results of that assessment. Existing law prohibits the supervisor from utilizing supervision via 2-way, real-time videoconferencing if their assessment finds it is inappropriate. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of those provisions indefinitely. By extending the operation of requirements, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires an applicant for licensure as a marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional clinical counselor to provide copies of tax returns for each year of experience claimed for purposes of satisfying the experience requirement for licensure.\n\nThis bill would require an applicant to provide the board with a copy of the applicant's most recent pay stub for experience gained during a tax year that has not ended by the date the application for licensure is received.\n\nExisting law requires direct supervisor contact for certain experience required for licensure as a marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional clinical counselor. Existing law, until January 1, 2026, authorizes contact to be via in-person contact, 2-way, real-time videoconferencing, or some combination of these, as specified. Existing law, effective January 1, 2026, authorizes only a supervisee working in an exempt setting, as specified, to obtain direct supervisor contact via 2-way, real-time videoconferencing.\n\nThis bill would make the above-described authorization related to videoconferencing permanent and would consequently delete the latter provision authorizing direct supervisor contact via videoconferencing in exempt settings.\n\nExisting law requires the board to issue a retired license to a marriage and family therapist, licensed educational psychologist, licensed professional clinical counselor, or clinical social worker upon satisfaction of specified requirements. Existing law also authorizes a person who holds a license in another jurisdiction of the United States as a marriage and family therapist, professional clinical counselor, or clinical social worker to practice in this state for a period not to exceed 30 consecutive days if they satisfy certain conditions, and deems a person who provides services pursuant to those provisions to have agreed to practicing under the jurisdiction of the board and to be bound by the laws of this state.\n\nThe bill would revise the requirements for the issuance of a retired license, including submitting a statement under penalty of perjury that, among other things, the information provided on the application is true and correct. The bill would require out-of-state marriage and family therapists, professional clinical counselors, and clinical social workers, as a condition of practicing in this state, to submit a signed statement under penalty of perjury acknowledging that they are subject to the jurisdiction of the board and agreeing to be bound by the laws of this state. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would revise the education, experience, and other qualifications required for licensure as an educational psychologist.\n\nThe bill would make various technical and other changes to the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act, the Educational Psychologist Practice Act, the Clinical Social Worker Practice Act, and the Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Act.\n\n(4) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 27 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by SB 861 to be operative only if this bill and SB 861 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Board of Behavioral Sciences."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
