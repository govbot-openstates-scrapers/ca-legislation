Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) , in consultation with the ISO, to establish resource adequacy requirements for all load-serving entities, defined as including electrical corporations, electric service providers, and community choice aggregators. Existing law, in establishing resource adequacy requirements, requires the PUC to ensure the reliability of electrical service in California, as provided. Existing law requires the ISO to ensure the efficient use and reliable operation of the transmission grid, consistent with certain criteria, and authorizes the ISO to amend its tariff to be consistent with that requirement, as deemed necessary and subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to the provision requiring the ISO to ensure the efficient use and reliable operation of the transmission grid."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
