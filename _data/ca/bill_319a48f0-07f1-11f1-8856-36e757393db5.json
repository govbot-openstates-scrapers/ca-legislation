Because this certification would be under penalty of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the definition of a crime.\n\nThis bill would authorize the office to impose and collect a fee from a water utility for an identification card that does not exceed the reasonable costs of the identification card program.\n\nThis bill would specify that the authorization for particular officers to close an area, as described above, shall not prevent an individual who holds a valid water utility worker identification card from entering an area so closed unless a peace officer finds that the disaster is of such a nature that it would be unsafe for the cardholder to enter or that the presence of the cardholder would interfere with disaster response.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
