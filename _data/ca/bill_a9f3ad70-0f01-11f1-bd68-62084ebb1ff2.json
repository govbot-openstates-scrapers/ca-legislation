Among other things, that law authorizes a development proponent to submit an application for a development that is subject to a specified streamlined, ministerial approval process and is not subject to a conditional use permit or any other nonlegislative discretionary approval if the development complies with certain requirements and satisfies specified objective planning standards. The California Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly Act requires the residents and operators of a residential care facility for the elderly to be considered a family for the purposes of any law or zoning ordinance that relates to the residential use of property, as specified.\n\nThis bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would relate to streamlining approvals for residential care facilities for the elderly."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
