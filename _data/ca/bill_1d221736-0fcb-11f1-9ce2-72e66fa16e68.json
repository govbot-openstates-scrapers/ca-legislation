Existing law regulates different types of continuing care contracts, including, among others, a repayable contract. A repayable contract is a continuing care contract that includes a promise to repay all or a portion of an entrance fee that is conditioned upon reoccupancy or resale of the unit previously occupied by the resident.\n\nThis bill would additionally define a repayable contract to include a continuing care contract that includes a promise to repay all or a portion of an entrance fee based on the sequential order in which repayable contracts are terminated. To repay entrance fees using the sequential order method, the bill would require a provider to assign each terminated contract a sequential repayment number, and each time entrance fees are paid for a reoccupied unit, a repayment account would be credited until funds are sufficient to repay the next terminated contract in sequential order. The bill would require a provider to issue this repayment within 14 days."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
