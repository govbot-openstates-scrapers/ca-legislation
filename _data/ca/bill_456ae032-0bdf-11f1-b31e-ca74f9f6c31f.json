During a state of emergency, existing law confers on the Governor, to the extent the Governor deems necessary, complete authority over all agencies of the state government and the right to exercise within the area designated all police power vested in the state by the Constitution and laws of the state to effectuate the purposes of the CESA.\n\nThis bill, instead, would authorize the Governor to exercise within the area designated all executive power vested in the state by the Constitution and laws of the state to effectuate the purposes of the CESA.\n\nExisting law requires the Governor to proclaim the termination of a state emergency at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant. Existing law requires all of the powers granted to the Governor by the CESA with respect to a state of emergency to terminate when the state of emergency has been terminated by proclamation of the Governor or by concurrent resolution of the Legislature declaring it at an end.\n\nThis bill would require a state of emergency that has not been terminated by the Governor to automatically terminate 90 days after the Governor's proclamation unless the Legislature extends it by a concurrent resolution, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
