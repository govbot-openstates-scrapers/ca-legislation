Existing law authorizes participating counties to pay for the services using moneys distributed to the counties from various continuously appropriated funds, including the Behavioral Health Services Fund when included in a county plan, as specified.\n\nFor participating counties, existing law authorizes a court to order a person who is the subject of a certain petition to obtain assisted outpatient treatment if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that various conditions are met, including, among others, that the person is experiencing a mental illness and that the person has a history of lack of compliance with treatment for their mental illness, as specified. Existing law sets forth certain rights of the person relating to the hearing and imposes conditions on an extension to an initial treatment order.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
