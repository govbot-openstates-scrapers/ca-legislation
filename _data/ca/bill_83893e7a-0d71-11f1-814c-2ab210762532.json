Existing law requires guardians and conservators to file inventories and accountings of estates with the court. Existing law authorizes the court to make an order that a guardian or conservator is exempt from making that accounting if certain conditions are satisfied, including, among others, that the estate at the beginning and end of the accounting period, exclusive of the residence of the ward or conservatee, consisted of a total net value of less than $15,000, and that the income of the estate for each month of the accounting period, exclusive of public benefits payments, was less than $2,000.\n\nThis bill would expand the authority of the court to make that exemption if the total net value of the estate, exclusive of the residence of the ward or conservatee, is less than $30,000, and if the monthly income of the estate, exclusive of public benefit payments, is less than $3,200, subject to the other statutory conditions being met."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
