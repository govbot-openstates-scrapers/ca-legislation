The act authorizes the use of campaign funds to pay or reimburse the state for security expenses to protect a candidate, an elected officer, or the immediate family or staff of a candidate or elected officer, as specified. The act defines \"security expenses\" to include, among other things, the reasonable costs of providing personal security to a candidate, elected officer, or the immediate family or staff of a candidate or elected officer. The act permits a candidate or elected officer to expend campaign funds for these purposes without any monetary cap until January 1, 2029.\n\nThis bill would limit the use of campaign funds to pay for security personnel to only those instances where the security personnel hold the appropriate license issued by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
