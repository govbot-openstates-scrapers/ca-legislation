Existing law authorizes a court to issue an ex parte protective order enjoining a party from, among other things, stalking, battering, or disturbing the peace of the other party.\n\nThis bill would authorize a court determining whether to issue a protective order to consider whether a military protective order has been issued against the respondent, as specified.\n\nThe bill would additionally require a law enforcement officer who receives information at the scene of a domestic violence incident that a military protective order has been issued to verify the existence of that order. The bill would require a law enforcement officer who determines that a military protective order has been issued against a person involved in the domestic violence incident who violates a provision of a domestic violence protective order to notify the law enforcement agency that entered the military protective order that the restrained party may be in violation of a military protective order. By increasing duties on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would authorize each law enforcement agency in the state that petitions for or enforces domestic violence protective orders to develop and adopt memoranda of understanding with military law enforcement or other designated representatives of one or more military installations located in whole or in part within the borders of its jurisdiction that govern the investigation and actions related to domestic violence involving service members assigned to units on those installations, as specified.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Family childcare homes: United States Armed Forces."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
