The act grants to the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board, an independent entity within the department, exclusive authority to adopt occupational safety and health standards within the state.\n\nBeginning July 1, 2018, and every 5 years thereafter, the act requires the board, in consultation with the department, to complete a comprehensive review of all revisions to National Fire Protection Association standards pertaining to certain personal protective equipment and requires the board to consider modifying existing safety orders and to render a decision regarding the adoption of necessary changes to safety orders, or other applicable standards and regulations, no later than July 1 of the subsequent year, if the review finds that the revisions to applicable National Fire Protection Association standards provide a greater degree of personal protection than the safety orders.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the board from adopting a safety order or regulation that requires the personal protective equipment described above and used exclusively by certain fire districts to be replaced more frequently than once every 15 years unless the board finds the personal protective equipment is unsafe due to wear and tear, poses an immediate safety hazard, or contains perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or any other currently known hazardous material."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
