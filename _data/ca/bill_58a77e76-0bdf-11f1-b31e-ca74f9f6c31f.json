A provision of the act requires each of the 3 segments of public postsecondary education to have as a fundamental policy the maintenance of a healthy and expanded student transfer system. The act applies to the University of California only to the extent that the regents, by appropriate resolution, make it applicable.\n\nThis bill would require the California State University, before September 1, 2026, to establish specific goals for the adequate representation of community college transfer students in each discipline, program, or major at the system level, and where feasible, at each campus, and would require the California State University to report on its internet website various ratios of community college transfer students to other undergraduates in its system, as provided.\n\nThe bill would request the University of California, before September 1, 2026, to establish a formal process for identifying the specific disciplines, programs, or majors where capacity increases for community college transfer students at individual campuses would be most valuable and would request the University of California to prioritize those areas for future capacity increases."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
