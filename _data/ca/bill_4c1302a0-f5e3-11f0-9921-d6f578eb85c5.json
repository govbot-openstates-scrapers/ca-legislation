Existing law states that an inmate imprisoned under a life sentence shall not be paroled until they have served the greater of either 7 years or the minimum term set in their sentence. Existing law, for defendants sentenced for murder, states that specified statutory provisions granting credits to reduce the term of imprisonment shall not apply to reduce the minimum term of imprisonment before the defendant may be paroled. Existing constitutional provisions grant the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation authority to award credits for good behavior and approved rehabilitative or educational achievements.\n\nThis bill would require the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to apply all applicable credits under those constitutional provisions to reduce the minimum term or minimum period of confinement of a person imprisoned under one or more life sentences.\n\nExisting law requires the Board of Parole Hearings, when considering a parole for an inmate, to consider, among other things, all statements and recommendations that may have been submitted by the judge, district attorney, and sheriff, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the Board of Parole Hearings to consider any reports filed by the probation officer."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Prisons: visitation."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
