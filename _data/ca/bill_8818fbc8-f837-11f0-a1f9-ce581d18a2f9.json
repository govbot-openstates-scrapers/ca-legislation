The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law, subject to any necessary federal approvals, sets forth various Medi-Cal provisions relating to complex rehabilitation technology (CRT) , which is a form of durable medical equipment, including, but not limited to, complex rehabilitation manual and power wheelchairs. Existing law requires a CRT provider to comply with certain standards, including with regard to CRT repairs. Existing law authorizes the department to adopt any utilization controls for CRT, as appropriate.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the department from requiring prior authorization for the repair of a CRT-powered wheelchair if the cost of the repair does not exceed $1,250. Under the bill, a treatment authorization request for repair or replacement of a CRT-powered wheelchair would not require an individual prescription or documentation of medical necessity from the treating practitioner if the CRT-powered wheelchair has already been approved for use by the patient.\n\nFor repair of a CRT-powered wheelchair, the bill would require the supplier to document and maintain records of the items being repaired, the reason for the repair, and the labor details, as specified, with the information being subject to a postpayment audit by the department. The bill would set forth other recording requirements for the supplier."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
