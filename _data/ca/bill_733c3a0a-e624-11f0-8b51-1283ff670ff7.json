Existing law requires a person who flees the scene of the crime after committing specified vehicle manslaughter while intoxicated or vehicle manslaughter to be punished for an additional term of imprisonment of 5 years in the state prison, upon conviction, and in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed.\n\nThis bill would instead require a person who violates the requirement to stop to be subject to punishment by imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years if the vehicle accident results in permanent, serious injury or death."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
