The bill would additionally authorize the Superintendent to conditionally approve or disapprove a budget that does not provide adequate assurance that the county office of education will meet its current and future obligations and resolve any problems identified in the studies, reports, evaluations, or audits, as specified.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Superintendent to notify the county board of education and the county superintendent of schools in writing if the Superintendent determines that a county office of education will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year, as provided. If the Superintendent makes that determination or if the county office of education has a negative certification, existing law requires the Superintendent to, as necessary to enable the county office of education to meet its financial obligations, take one or more specified actions. Existing law requires a county office of education to pay 75% of fees charged by the Superintendent for administrative expenses incurred for undertaking the required actions or for costs associated with improving the county office of education's financial management practices and requires the other 25% to be covered by the Superintendent.\n\nThis bill would revise certain provisions related to the above-described requirements, including, among other things, by requiring the Superintendent to additionally notify the president of the State Board of Education, or the president's designee, if the Superintendent determines that a county office of education will be unable to meet its financial obligations, as provided, including if a county office of education experiences a significant fiscal event that is determined by the Superintendent to have an immediate severe fiscal impact that will cause a county office of education to be unable to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year. The bill would revise and recast the provision related to fees and costs to instead require a county office of education to pay 75% of, and the Superintendent to pay 25% of, specified administrative expenses incurred or costs associated with improving the county office of education's financial management practices.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program as a state early learning initiative with the goal of expanding access to classroom-based prekindergarten programs. Existing law appropriates $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education in both the 2021\u201322 fiscal year and the 2022\u201323 fiscal year for allocation to local educational agencies as base grants, enrollment grants, and supplemental grants, as specified.

The act requires the Superintendent to develop and administer a grant process and award grant funds to each county that applies for funding, as provided.\n\nThis bill would extend the expenditure and reversion periods for those grant funds, as specified, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would also extend the deadline by 3 years for a report to be submitted by the Superintendent to the Department of Finance and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature on the expenditure of funds and relevant outcome data in order to evaluate the impact of the grants awarded under this program.\n\n(5) Existing law establishes the Inclusive Early Education Expansion Program for the purpose of increasing access to inclusive early care and education programs. Existing law appropriates $250,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent for allocation to local educational agencies for purposes of this program. Existing law authorizes the Superintendent to allocate up to $50,000,000 of the $250,000,000 to address state-level systems building and align local practice with the research and practice-based strategies that best promote pupil outcomes and program quality.\n\nThis bill would instead reduce the above-described allocation to $10,000,000.\n\n(6) Existing law appropriates $2,836,660,000 in the 2021\u201322 fiscal year from the General Fund to the Superintendent to administer the California Community Schools Partnership Program and requires those funds to be available for encumbrance or expenditure until June 30, 2032. Existing law requires up to 72% of the funds to be available for implementation grants and at least 18% to be available for extending implementation grants, as provided.\n\nThis bill would authorize funds initially made available for implementation grants that are returned to the State Department of Education to be available for extending implementation grants. By expanding the purposes for which previously appropriated moneys may be expended, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(7) Existing law requires the Controller to draw warrants on the State Treasury throughout each year in specified amounts for purposes of apportioning funding to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools. Existing law requires warrants in the amount of $245,604,000 scheduled to be drawn in June of the 2024\u201325 fiscal year to instead be drawn in July of the same calendar year, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the amount of the warrants scheduled to be drawn in June of the 2024\u201325 fiscal year to instead be $245,604,000, or the total June principal apportionment payment, whichever is less. The bill would require, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, warrants for the principal apportionments for the month of June in the amount of $1,874,781,000, or the total June principal apportionment payment, whichever is less, to instead be drawn in July of the same calendar year, except as provided.\n\n(8) Existing law, the Leroy F. Greene State School Building Lease-Purchase Law of 1976, authorizes the State Allocation Board to apportion state funding to applicant school districts for designated school facilities construction purposes. Existing law creates a county school lease-purchase fund in the county treasury within each county for each school district project in the county. Existing law authorizes funds to be expended from the county school lease-purchase fund by the applicant school district only when specifically authorized by the board for either direct project costs or reimbursements, except as provided. Existing law prohibits the board from approving any projects pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene State School Building Lease-Purchase Law of 1976 and requires the board to only approve and fund school facilities construction projects pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would provide that all funds, including any interest earned on funds, in a county school lease-purchase fund for a school district that remain in the fund on and after January 1, 2026, shall not be reported or returned to the state and would authorize the interest to be used by the school district for capital outlay expenditures for school construction. By authorizing those state funds to be expended by a school district, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(9) The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 provides for the adoption of rules, regulations, and procedures, under the administration of the Director of General Services, for the allocation of state funds by the State Allocation Board for the construction and modernization of public school facilities. The act, among other things, provides that a school district is eligible for health and safety funding to replace, reconstruct, or construct new classrooms and related facilities if the school district demonstrates there is a threat to the health and safety of pupils, as provided.\n\nThis bill would separately authorize a school district to apply for hardship assistance in cases of extraordinary circumstances, as specified.\n\n(10) Existing law creates the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund in the State Treasury for the purpose of receiving appropriations for school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and community college districts related to the state of emergency declared by the Governor on March 4, 2020, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing law appropriates $6,345,405,000 from the General Fund to the department for transfer to the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund. Existing law requires the Superintendent to allocate these appropriated funds to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, as provided.\n\nThis bill would appropriate an additional $378,650,000 from the General Fund to the department for transfer to the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund, to be allocated by the Superintendent to those local educational agencies operating in the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, as provided.\n\n(11) Existing law establishes the department, under the administration of the Superintendent, and assigns to the department numerous duties relating to the financing, governance, and guidance of the public elementary and secondary schools in this state.\n\nThis bill would require, no later than September 30, 2026, the state board to approve and the department to post on its internet website criteria and guidance for the selection or development of inservice professional development programs for effective means of teaching literacy in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, or any of grades 1 to 5, inclusive, with a list of inservice professional development programs that have been deemed to meet those criteria. The bill would appropriate $200,000,000 from the General Fund to the department to make available to local educational agencies to expend from the 2026\u201327 fiscal year to the 2029\u201330 fiscal year, inclusive, for purposes of training certificated and classified staff who provide literacy instruction, or who support any teacher who provides literacy instruction, using the professional development programs that meet the criteria and guidance, as provided. The bill would require recipient local educational agencies to report specified information to the department, and would require the department to submit a summary of this information to the Legislature and the Department of Finance, as provided.\n\n(12) Existing law requires the accounting system used to record the financial affairs of a school district to be in accordance with the definitions, instructions, and procedures published in the California School Accounting Manual, as approved by the state board and furnished by the Superintendent.\n\nThis bill would require the accounting system used to record the financial affairs of any local educational agency, as defined, to be designed to provide a separate accounting of expenditures related to actual payments of legal settlements, judgments, or special assessments by a joint pooling arrangement, as a result of specified childhood sexual assault claims and a separate accounting of those expenditures as a result of all other civil claims, as provided. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(13) Existing law appropriates $50,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent to apportion to the Orange County Department of Education to award no less than $30,000,000 as grants to local educational agencies for the purpose of funding schoolwide and districtwide implementation of services or practices aligned to the Multi-Tiered Systems of Support framework. Existing law requires the grants to be awarded on or before December 15, 2021, and any funds not awarded on or before December 15, 2021, to be available for the Orange County Department of Education, in consultation with the Superintendent and the executive director of the state board, to award as grants to local educational agencies on or before December 15, 2022.\n\nThis bill would require funds not awarded on or before December 15, 2022, to be available for the Orange County Department of Education to provide support to local educational agencies impacted by the fire-related state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor in January 2025, as provided. The bill would authorize the Orange County Department of Education to expend up to 15% of those funds for administrative costs. By expanding the purposes of a previous appropriation, the bill would make an appropriation. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on the Orange County Department of Education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(14) Existing law requires, not later than May 1 of each fiscal year, the governing board of each local educational agency to provide for an audit of the books and accounts of the local educational agency, including an audit of income and expenditures by source of funds, or make arrangements with the county superintendent of schools having jurisdiction over the local educational agency to provide for that auditing. If the governing board of a school district has entered into a contract for an independent audit of its financial statements and the statements have not been filed according to specified due dates, existing law authorizes the county superintendent of schools to investigate the causes for the delay and initiate a specified action that will provide the required audited financial statements in the most effective manner, including, among other actions, granting an appropriate extension for the completion of the audit and the filing of the audited statements, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require an extension granted by a county superintendent of schools to be the shortest amount of time reasonable, be in increments of no longer than 45 calendar days, and, collectively, not exceed a total of 90 calendar days from the due date established, as provided.\n\n(15) For the 1990\u201391 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, existing law requires that moneys to be applied by the state for the support of school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary and secondary level instructional services provided by the state be distributed in accordance with certain calculations governing the proration of those moneys among the 3 segments of public education. Existing law makes that provision inapplicable to the 1992\u201393 to 2024\u201325 fiscal years, inclusive.\n\nThis bill would also make that provision inapplicable to the 2025\u201326 fiscal year.\n\n(16) Existing law requires the governing board of a school district to report to the Superintendent during each fiscal year the average daily attendance of the school district for all full school months, as provided. Existing law requires the average daily attendance to be determined by dividing the total number of days of attendance allowed in all full school months by the number of days the schools are actually taught in all full school months, excluding Saturdays or Sundays and excluding weekend makeup classes. Existing law also excludes from those calculations attendance generated through an attendance recovery program.\n\nThis bill, relative to attendance recovery programs, would instead exclude from those calculations only those weekend and intersession days that generated attendance for an attendance recovery program.\n\n(17) Existing law prohibits the Superintendent from making an apportionment for the current fiscal year of state or federal moneys for a county office of education that neglects or refuses to make a county office of education budget or neglects to file specified interim reports, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally prohibit the Superintendent from making an apportionment for a county office of education if the county board of education or county superintendent of schools neglects or refuses to adopt a local control and accountability plan (LCAP) or an annual update to an LCAP, except as provided.\n\n(18) Existing law requires the Superintendent to examine a revised budget, as specified, and, not later than November 8, approve or disapprove the revised budget. If the Superintendent disapproves the revised budget, existing law requires the Superintendent to call for the formation of a budget review committee, and requires the budget review committee, on or before November 30, to review the proposed budget, as specified. If a county superintendent of schools disapproves the budget of a school district, existing law requires the county superintendent of schools to call for the formation of a budget review committee, and requires the budget review committee, on or before November 30, to review the proposed budget, as specified. Existing law requires the members of the budget review committee to be reimbursed for their services and associated expenses while on official business, at rates established by the state board.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast the provision requiring members of the budget committee to be reimbursed to instead require the reimbursement rates to be established by the Superintendent, subject to the approval of the director of the state board, and would prohibit employees of the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team from being eligible for reimbursement.\n\n(19) Existing law requires the county superintendent of schools to notify various entities, in writing, if the county superintendent of schools determines that a school district will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent year, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the county superintendent of schools to also provide the above-described notification if a school district experiences a significant fiscal event that the county superintendent of schools determines will have an immediate severe fiscal impact that will cause a school district to be unable to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year. To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(20) Existing law prohibits a county superintendent of schools from making an apportionment for the current school year of state or county moneys for a school district if the governing board of the school district neglects or refuses to make a school district budget or neglects to file specified interim reports, as provided.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast those provisions to, among other things, prohibit a county superintendent of schools from making an apportionment of state, local, or county moneys for a school district if the governing board of the school district or the school district neglects or refuses to adopt an LCAP or an annual update to an LCAP, except as provided. The bill would also apply these provisions to a charter school, as provided. To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on local officials or local educational entities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(21) Existing law requires school districts and county offices of education to transmit to the State Department of Education, on a timely basis, various reports. If those reports are not submitted to the Superintendent within 14 days after the submission date specified for each report, existing law authorizes the Superintendent to direct the county auditor to withhold payment of any stipend, expenses, or salaries of the district superintendent, county superintendent of schools, or members of the governing board, as appropriate, until the delinquent reports have been submitted, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally require school districts and county offices of education to transmit LCAPs and annual updates to the LCAPs, as provided. The bill would extend those provisions to charter schools. The bill would require schools districts and charter schools to also transmit those reports, plans, and annual updates to the county superintendent of schools on a timely basis, and would authorize the county superintendent of schools to withhold payment of any stipend, expenses, benefits, or salaries and wages of the district superintendent, charter school administrator, or members of the governing board, as appropriate, until the delinquent reports have been submitted, except as provided. To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on local officials or local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(22) Existing law requires the department, by July 1, 2025, to update a salary and benefit schedule form, as described, to include salary data collection for classified school staff assigned to a schoolsite or sites in the same manner as that data is collected for certificated staff assigned to a schoolsite or sites, and to call this updated form the Salary and Benefit Schedule for the Bargaining Units (Form J\u201390) . Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and direct-funded charter schools, by January 31, 2026, and annually thereafter, to complete the Form J\u201390 for specified classified and certificated staff assigned to a schoolsite or sites and report the Form J\u201390 to the department, and authorizes those local educational agencies to complete and report the Form J\u201390 for prior fiscal years, as provided. Existing law requires the department, by August 31, 2026, and annually thereafter, to report to the Legislature on the progress of school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools in increasing salaries for classified and certificated staff assigned to a schoolsite or sites, as provided.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast those provisions by instead requiring the department, by July 1, 2026, to create a data collection system for salary and benefits data for represented certificated and classified nonmanagement employees. The bill would require the data collected to include salary, benefits, and full-time equivalent employee counts for certificated employees and for specified classified bargaining unit classifications, which the bill would require to be collected in the same manner as for certificated employees, as determined by the department. The bill would require, by August 31, 2026, and by July 1 annually thereafter, school districts, county offices of education, and direct-funded charter schools to complete the data collection process and to report the data to the department. The bill would require the department, by January 31, 2027, and by November 30 annually thereafter, to report to the Legislature on the progress of school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools in increasing salaries for classified and certificated employees, as provided. By imposing new duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(23) Existing law establishes a public school financing system that requires state funding for school districts and charter schools to be calculated pursuant to a local control funding formula, as specified. Existing law requires funding pursuant to the local control funding formula to include, among other things, a base grant that in each fiscal year is adjusted for inflation by the percentage change in the annual average value of the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government Purchases of Goods and Services for the United States, as specified. Existing law, commencing with the 2022\u201323 fiscal year, requires the Superintendent to compute an additional add-on for school districts and charter schools of $2,813 for transitional kindergarten, as specified, and requires the add-on to be annually adjusted for inflation commencing with the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, as specified.\n\nThis bill, commencing with the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, would increase that transitional kindergarten add-on to instead be $5,545, and would require that increased add-on to be annually adjusted for inflation commencing with the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the local control funding formula to include, in addition to the base grant, supplemental and concentration grant add-ons that are based on the percentage of pupils who are unduplicated pupils, as defined to include English learners, pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals, and foster youth, as specified. Existing law requires school districts and charter schools to annually report their enrollment of unduplicated pupils to the Superintendent, as specified, and requires county superintendents of schools to review and validate that pupil data, as provided. Existing law defines \"pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals\" to mean pupils determined to meet federal income eligibility criteria, either through completing an application for the federal National School Lunch Program or through an alternative household income data collection form, or deemed to be categorically eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program.\n\nThis bill would revise that definition to also include pupils determined to meet federal income eligibility criteria through a federal Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) - compliant Universal Benefit Application. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on county superintendents of schools, school districts, and charter schools related to reporting unduplicated pupils, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Notwithstanding any other law, for purposes of the local control funding formula for the 2025\u201326 and 2026\u201327 fiscal years only, the bill would require the count of English learner pupils enrolled in transitional kindergarten to be equal to the count of English learner pupils enrolled in kindergarten, as specified.\n\nFor purposes of state apportionments, if the average daily attendance of a school district, county office of education, or charter school during a fiscal year has been materially decreased during a fiscal year because of an emergency, existing law requires the Superintendent to estimate the average daily attendance in a manner that credits to the school district, county office of education, or charter school the total average daily attendance that would have been credited had the emergency not occurred, as provided.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding any other law, for specified charter schools that were damaged, destroyed, or directly impacted as a result of a state of emergency that was declared by the Governor in January 2025, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, would require the Superintendent to calculate the difference between the charter school's certified local control funding formula entitlement in the 2025\u201326 fiscal year and the 2024\u201325 fiscal year, as specified, and, if there is a difference, allocate the amount of that difference to the charter school.\n\n(24) The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012, an initiative measure approved by the voters at the November 6, 2012, statewide general election, among other things, increased certain tax rates for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2012, and before January 1, 2017, and deposited the revenues from those increases in tax into the Education Protection Account. The act provides that all moneys in the Education Protection Account are continuously appropriated for the support of school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and community college districts. These provisions were extended for taxable years before January 1, 2031, by Proposition 55, an initiative measure approved by the voters at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.\n\nThis bill would require, in any fiscal year, if a decline in Education Protection Account revenue results in a nontransfer of funds into the Education Protection Account fourth-quarter payment, the Superintendent to recover a local educational agency's overpayment of Education Protection Account funds from the current year's second principal apportionment payment, as provided.\n\n(25) Existing law establishes the Public School System Stabilization Account to provide a reserve for public school funding. Existing law requires, pursuant to specified calculations, the Controller to transfer certain moneys from the General Fund into the Public School System Stabilization Account for subsequent allocation to school districts and community college districts, as specified. Existing law requires, in any fiscal year in which the amount required to be applied by the state for the support of school districts and community college districts for that fiscal year is less than the total allocations to school districts and community college districts from General Fund proceeds of taxes appropriated and allocated local proceeds of taxes in the prior fiscal year, as adjusted pursuant to specified calculations, the amount of the deficiency to be appropriated and allocated by the state from the Public School System Stabilization Account for the support of school districts and community college districts.\n\nThis bill would appropriate, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, $405,291,000 from the Public School System Stabilization Account to the Superintendent for allocation for the local control funding formula, as provided.\n\n(26) Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to administer a State Assignment Accountability System to provide local educational agencies with a data system for assignment monitoring. Existing law requires the commission to annually use data it receives from the department to produce an initial data file of vacant positions and assignments that do not have a clear match of credential to assignment. Existing law requires a monitoring authority, as defined, to review and determine any potential misassignments and vacant positions, as defined, reported in and identified through the system for local educational agencies within its authority, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, among other things, rename the system as the California Statewide Assignment Accountability System and would require the commission to also identify instances of a teacher shortage, as specified, in each instance where, as of Census Day, either (A) a course or class assignment is permanently filled by an employee who is not fully credentialed or who is not appropriately assigned or (B) the local educational agency identifies a vacant position or an unfilled position, as provided. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies, including in their capacity as monitoring authorities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(27) Existing law requires the commission to establish standards for the issuance and renewal of credentials, certificates, and permits. Existing law requires the commission to develop, adopt, and administer a reading instruction competence assessment consisting of one or more instruments to measure an individual's knowledge, skill, and ability relative to effective reading instruction, as provided. Under existing law, the passage of one of specified components of the reading instruction competence assessment is a requirement for the issuance of the preliminary multiple subject teaching credential or the preliminary education specialist credential, until the commission ensures that an approved teaching performance assessment assesses candidates for competence in instruction in literacy. Existing law requires the commission to ensure that these teaching performance assessments assess competence in instruction in literacy by July 1, 2025.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the commission to adopt an off-the-shelf assessment that otherwise meets the specified requirements for the reading instruction competence assessment. The bill would authorize credential candidates that are required to pass the reading instruction competence assessment in order to earn the clear credential to take and pass the reading instruction competence assessment on or before October 31, 2025, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the commission to exempt specified preliminary multiple subject credential candidates and preliminary single subject credential candidates who complete specified induction program and service requirements on or before June 30, 2025, from the requirement, and any accompanying regulations, to complete a teaching performance assessment.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to additionally exempt the above-described credential candidates from the requirement, and any accompanying regulations, to complete a reading instruction competence assessment, as provided. The bill would extend, for purposes of the exemption, the date by which the credential candidates are required to complete the induction program and service requirements by one year.\n\n(28) Under existing regulations adopted by the commission, applicants who seek to satisfy a credential, certificate, permit, or waiver requirement by examination are required to meet the passing score requirements established by the commission that were in effect at the time the examination was taken. These regulations also limit the time between the date the score was earned and the issuance date of the applicable credential, certificate, permit, or waiver to 10 years, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead establish that an applicant for a preliminary multiple subject teaching credential or a preliminary education specialist instruction credential holds a passing reading instruction competence assessment score prospectively if, within the 10 calendar years following the date the score was earned, the applicant has achieved specified reading instruction competence assessment examination scores, as provided.\n\n(29) Existing law establishes the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program under the administration of the State Department of Education to award grants to teachers who have, among other things, attained certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, as provided.\n\nThis bill would appropriate, for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, $30,000,000 from the General Fund to the department for purposes of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program and for covering National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification fees, as provided. The bill would make those funds available for encumbrance until June 30, 2030, and available for liquidation until June 30, 2034.\n\nExisting law appropriates $250,000,000 from the General Fund to the department in the 2021\u201322 fiscal year for purposes of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program and for covering National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification fees, as provided. Existing law requires those moneys to be available for encumbrance until June 30, 2026, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead make those moneys available for encumbrance until June 30, 2030, and available for liquidation until June 30, 2034, thereby making an appropriation.\n\nThe bill, commencing July 1, 2027, would transfer the administrative duties of the program from the department to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and would require the department to transfer all unencumbered funds available for the program to the commission to award grants for the program.\n\n(30) Existing law requires the commission to adopt standards for the accreditation of postsecondary teacher preparation programs. Existing law prescribes \"clinical practice\" as one of the commission-adopted standards and requires that teaching credential candidates perform 600 hours of clinical practice throughout the candidate's teacher preparation program, including, as a component of those hours, unpaid student teaching.\n\nThis bill would establish the Student Teacher Stipend Program under the administration of the commission to support prospective educators, as defined, during their completion 500 or more hours of student teaching, as provided. The bill would require local educational agencies awarded funding pursuant to the program to provide stipends of $10,000 to be paid during the school year in which the credential candidates are completing their student teaching.

Existing law subjects local educational agencies to an audit, as specified, to determine compliance with those requirements. Existing law prohibits a local educational agency with prior year classroom-based average daily attendance in kindergarten and grades 1 to 6, inclusive, from receiving less than $50,000 under the program in a fiscal year.\n\nThe bill, commencing with the 2025\u201326 school year, would (A) lower the unduplicated pupil percentage requirement for funding availability, and its associated funding conditions, from 75% to 55%, (B) revise auditing requirements for certain local educational agencies, as specified, and (C) double the minimum funding for local educational agencies under the program to $100,000 in a fiscal year.
