Existing law requires that the housing element, among other things, sets forth a schedule of actions during the planning period that the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals of the housing element, as provided. Existing law authorizes the Department of Housing and Community Development to allow a city or county to substitute the provision of units pursuant to this schedule of actions if the community includes in its housing element a program committing the local government to provide specified units that will be made available through the provision of committed assistance to lower income households at affordable housing costs or rents, as defined. Existing law requires a unit to meet specified requirements to qualify for inclusion in the program. Existing law defines \"committed assistance\" for these purposes to mean that the city or county enters into a legally enforceable agreement during a specified time period that obligates sufficient available funds or other in-kind services to provide the assistance necessary to make the identified units affordable and that requires that the units be made available for occupancy within 2 years of the execution of the agreement.\n\nThis bill would define \"in-kind services\" for these purposes."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing element compliance: Housing Accountability Act: housing disapprovals."}, {"note": "", "title": "General plan: annual report: suite-style student housing quarters."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
