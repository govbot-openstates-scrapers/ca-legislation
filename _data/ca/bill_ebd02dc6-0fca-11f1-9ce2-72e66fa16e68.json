The act further declares that it is the policy of the state that planning for new transmission facilities consider specified goals, including increasing systemwide reliability and cost efficiency and eliminating transmission constraints that prevent electrical generation resources from delivering to the wider electrical grid, as provided.\n\nThis bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation to address cost containment, affordability, and the continued integration of renewable energy resources into the electrical transmission and distribution grid."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
