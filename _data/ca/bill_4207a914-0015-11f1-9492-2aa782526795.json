The act establishes a board of directors and vests the board with government of the district. The act requires a member of the board to receive $100 for attending a noticed meeting of the board, up to 4 noticed board meetings per month, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead require a member of the board to receive $200 for attending a noticed meeting of the board, up to 3 noticed board meetings per month. By requiring the district to increase compensation to a member of the board, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
