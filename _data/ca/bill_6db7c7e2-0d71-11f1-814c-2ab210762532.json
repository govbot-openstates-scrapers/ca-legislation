The Medi-Cal program is in part governed by, and funded pursuant to, federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law sets forth a schedule of benefits covered under the Medi-Cal program, including acupuncture, but only to the extent federal matching funds are provided for acupuncture.\n\nThis bill would remove the limitation requiring federal matching funds for acupuncture to be a covered benefit, thereby making acupuncture a covered benefit under Medi-Cal."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
