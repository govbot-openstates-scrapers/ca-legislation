Existing law establishes various programs that provide financial aid to students attending institutions in each of the segments.\n\nThis bill would, commencing with the 2027\u201328 academic year, require the California State University, community college districts, and private postsecondary educational institutions and independent institutions of higher education that receive state financial assistance to, and would request the University of California to, for a student whose financial aid award is delayed due to factors that are outside of the student's control, extend specified enrollment and financial deadlines and refrain from imposing punitive actions, as defined. By imposing new duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
