Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy to provide coverage for all generally medically accepted cancer screening tests.\n\nThis bill would require a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027, that provides coverage for hospital, medical, or surgical expenses to provide coverage for followup screening or diagnostic services for lung cancer, as specified. The bill would prohibit a contract or policy from imposing a copayment, coinsurance, deductible, or any other form of cost sharing for this coverage. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
