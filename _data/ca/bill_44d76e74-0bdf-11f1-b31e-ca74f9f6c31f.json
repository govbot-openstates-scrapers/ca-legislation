Pursuant to that authority, existing law requires a manager or other responsible person to reside upon the premises and have charge of every apartment house in which there are 16 or more apartments, as specified.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a state or local entity from requiring a manager or other caretaker to reside upon the premises of an apartment house and would require the department to update its regulations, as specified.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
