Existing law requires each public utility to furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, just, and reasonable service, instrumentalities, equipment, and facilities, as are necessary to promote the safety, health, comfort, and convenience of its patrons, employees, and the public.\n\nExisting law requires the commission to annually publish a report, pursuant to commission requirements, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, on or before January 1, 2027, to require each large electrical corporation, as defined, to commence a study to evaluate significant voltage-related incidents, as defined, across its residential, commercial, and industrial customers that resulted in damage to customer-owned equipment, appliances, or property totaling $5,000 or more, as provided. The bill would require the commission, on or before July 1, 2027, to publish hyperlinks on its internet website to the studies, and to report on the studies to the Legislature.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Voltage changes: consumer protection."}, {"note": "", "title": "Power surges: ratepayer notice."}, {"note": "", "title": "Voltage changes: consumer protection: study and report."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
