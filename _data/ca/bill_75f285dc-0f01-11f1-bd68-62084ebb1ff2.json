Proposition 7 authorizes the Legislature to amend these provisions by a 23 vote to change the dates and times of the daylight saving time period, consistent with federal law, and authorizes the Legislature to amend these provisions by a 23 vote to provide for the application of year-round daylight saving time when authorized by federal law.\n\nThis bill would repeal daylight saving time in the state and the provisions regarding the Legislature's authority to amend the above-described provisions by a 23 vote. The bill would instead require the state and all political subdivisions of the state to observe year-round standard time. The bill would exempt the state and all political subdivisions of the state from the provisions of federal law that establish the advancement of time. If the federal government adopts year-long daylight saving time, the bill would require the state and all political subdivisions of the state to set time to conform with that adoption, as specified.
