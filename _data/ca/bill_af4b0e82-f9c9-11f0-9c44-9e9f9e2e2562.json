Existing law provides for the preparation of a proposed infrastructure financing plan, as provided, which takes effect upon adoption by the public financing authority of the district following a specified public hearing and protest procedure. Existing law authorizes the infrastructure financing plan to provide for the division of taxes levied on taxable property in the area included within the district, as specified, and authorizes the public financing authority to issue bonds by adopting a resolution containing specified provisions, including a determination of the amount of tax revenue available or estimated to be available for the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the bonds.\n\nThis bill would establish the California Capital City Downtown Revitalization Act, and would authorize the City or County of Sacramento to create an enhanced infrastructure financing district within the downtown Sacramento geographic area. The bill would authorize an affected taxing entity located entirely, or in part, in the County of Sacramento to opt in to the district.\n\nExisting law specifies that an enhanced infrastructure financing district is not prohibited from utilizing revenues from additional sources to support its activities if the district obtains voter approval, as applicable, and the infrastructure financing plan is approved.\n\nThis bill would additionally specify that a district is not prohibited from utilizing state funds to support its activities if the district obtains voter approval, as applicable, and the infrastructure financing plan is approved. The bill would also specify that the California Capital City Downtown Revitalization District may accept state funds, as provided.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the downtown Sacramento geographic area.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 53398.75 of the Government Code proposed by SB 5 to be operative only if this bill and SB 5 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Capital City Downtown Revitalization Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
