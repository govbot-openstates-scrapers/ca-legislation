{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1873", "title": "County of Ventura: fire suppression: backup energy source.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["CountyofVentura", "backupenergysource", "firesuppression"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires, by July 1, 2030, a water supplier, as defined, to have access to sufficient backup energy sources to operate critical fire suppression infrastructure, as defined, needed to supply water for at least 24 hours for the purpose of fire suppression in high or very high fire hazard severity zones in the County of Ventura, or to have access to alternative sources of water supplied by a different water supplier or agency that can serve this same purpose of supplying backup water to critical wells and water pumps for 24 hours, as provided. Existing law authorizes a water supplier that uses a backup energy source that is not permanent and stationary to use mobile backup energy sources or procure an energy source via an established mutual aid agreement provided that the backup energy source can provide power within 12 hours of the National Weather Service alerting the County of Ventura of a red flag warning and provide power for at least 24 hours after a loss of power and within 60 minutes of a loss of power. Existing law requires, if any fire damages and makes uninhabitable more than 10 residential dwellings within the service area of a water supplier, a report be made by the Ventura County Fire Department in cooperation with the water supplier, as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a water supplier to use a backup energy source that is not permanent or stationary, provided that the backup energy source can, among other things, provide power within 90 minutes of a loss of power, or as soon as practically possible after deenergization. The bill would require a water supplier that uses a backup energy source that is not permanent and stationary to notify the Ventura County Office of Emergency Services as soon as practically possible if that backup energy source does not provide power within 90 minutes of a loss of power. The bill would require a water supplier that used a backup energy source to include in the report made by the Ventura County Fire Department, in cooperation with the water supplier, whether that water supplier made a notification to the Ventura County Office of Emergency Services due to a loss of power and the amount of time critical infrastructure for that water supplier experienced a loss of power, if applicable.\n\nExisting law requires a water supplier, in coordination with the Ventura County Office of Emergency Services and the Ventura County Fire Department, to establish an emergency preparedness plan, as specified, for response to red flag warnings, extreme weather events, and other major power outages or emergencies that pose a potential threat to providing water service.\n\nThis bill would require the emergency preparedness plan described above to be established by July 1, 2027. To the extent the bill would require a higher level of service by local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Ventura.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
