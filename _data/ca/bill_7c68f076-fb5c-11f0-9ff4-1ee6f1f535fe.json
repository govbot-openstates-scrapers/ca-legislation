{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1470", "title": "Food facilities: retail food safety.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Foodfacilities", "retailfoodsafety"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, establishes uniform health and sanitation standards for retail food facilities. Under existing law, local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing these standards. Under existing law, a person who violates any provision of the California Retail Food Code is guilty of a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided.\n\nExisting law prohibits a food facility from locating a grease trap or grease interceptor in a food handling area, unless approved by an enforcement agency. Existing law exempts from the prohibition a food facility with an approved grease trap or grease interceptor that was in operation before the effective date of the code.\n\nThis bill would instead prohibit a food facility from locating a grease trap or grease interceptor in a food preparation area. The bill would additionally exempt a grease trap or grease interceptor from this prohibition if (1) a structural hardship can be determined preventing the grease trap or grease interceptor from being installed in an area not designated for food preparation or food storage or a utensil handling area, (2) the site can provide a cleaning or maintenance plan that indicates how and when the grease trap or grease interceptor will be accessed for service to prevent any cross contamination of food or food contact surfaces, and (3) the site can provide procedures that will be taken to properly clean and sanitize the area following servicing.\n\nExisting law limits the size of a passthrough window service opening to 216 square inches. Existing law authorizes a passthrough window of up to 432 square inches if equipped with an air curtain device.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize a passthrough window service opening of up to 432 square inches if equipped with an air curtain device or equipped with a self-closing device. The bill would authorize a passthrough service opening that is larger than 432 square inches if equipped with both a self-closing device and an air curtain device. The bill would authorize an enforcement agency to approve alternative passthrough window or other service openings if the proposed alternative can adequately maintain exclusion of vermin or other means of contamination.\n\nExisting law requires a food facility's walls and ceilings to be durable, smooth, nonabsorbent, and easily cleanable. Existing law exempts from this requirement walls and ceilings of bar areas in which alcoholic beverages are sold or served directly to the consumers, except wall areas adjacent to bar sinks and areas where food is prepared, among other things. Existing law also exempts from this requirement restrooms that are used exclusively by the consumers, except that the walls and ceilings in the restrooms shall be of a nonabsorbent and washable surface.\n\nThis bill would instead exempt walls and ceilings of bar areas in which beverages are sold, served, or dispensed directly to the consumers. The bill would also instead exempt restrooms that are used exclusively by employees.\n\nExisting law requires temporary food facilities to be equipped with overhead protection for all food preparation, food storage, and warewashing areas. Existing law requires overhead protection to be made of wood, canvas, or other materials that protect the facility from precipitation, dust, bird and insect droppings, and other contaminants. Existing law exempts from these requirements a temporary food facility that is approved for limited food preparation if flying insects, vermin, birds, and other pests are absent due to the location of the facility or other limiting conditions.\n\nThis bill would additionally exempt a temporary food facility that is approved for limited food preparation from these requirements if environmental factors that could contaminate the food are absent due to the location of the facility or other limiting conditions.\n\nBy revising the standards that must be enforced by local health agencies and by expanding the scope of existing crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2022."}, {"note": "", "title": "Food facilities: retail food safety: coastal development permits: exemption."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
