A violation of the act is a crime, unless otherwise specified. Existing law makes it unprofessional conduct for a failure of a physician and surgeon to maintain adequate and accurate records relating to the provision of services to their patients for at least 7 years after the last date of service to a patient. \n\nThis bill would state that a physician and surgeon's patient medical documentation shall be the responsibility of that physician and surgeon. The bill would prohibit a physician and surgeon's patient notes, after-visit summaries, and diagnoses and treatment plans from being altered, modified, or edited in any fashion by anyone other than the authoring physician and surgeon. By expanding the scope of a crime under the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
