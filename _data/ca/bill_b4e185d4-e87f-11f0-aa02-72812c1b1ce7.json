Existing law requires a mandated reporter of suspected financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult, as defined, to report financial abuse in a specified manner. Existing law deems specified persons to be mandated reporters of suspected financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult, including, among others, all officers and employees of a financial institution. A mandated reporter who fails to report financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult is liable for civil penalties, as specified. \n\nThis bill would require a financial institution to provide annual training to its mandated reporters on how to report suspected financial abuse of an elder or a dependent adult to both local and federal authorities, as specified. The bill would require a financial institution to share information on reporting mechanisms with clients immediately upon discovering potential financial abuse and would require the financial institution to encourage clients to submit complaints within 24 to 48 hours. Under the bill, a violation of the requirement to share that information upon discovering potential financial abuse would not incur the above-described civil liability."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
