The act also sets forth specific public contracting requirements for certain transit districts, including the San Mateo County Transit District for construction work contracts. The act authorizes certain local agencies, including school districts and community college districts, to engage in job order contracting, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would establish a pilot program to authorize the San Mateo County Transit District to use job order contracting as a procurement method. The bill would impose a $5,000,000 cap on awards under a single job order contract and a $1,000,000 cap on any single job order. The bill would limit the term of an initial contract to a maximum of 12 months, with extensions as prescribed. The bill would establish various procedures and requirements for the use of job order contracting under the pilot program. The bill would require the district, on or before January 1, 2030, to submit to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature a report on the use of job order contracting under the bill. The pilot program would be repealed on January 1, 2032.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the San Mateo County Transit District."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
