Existing law provides for the preparation of a proposed infrastructure financing plan, as provided, which takes effect upon adoption by the public financing authority of the district following a specified public hearing and protest procedure. Existing law authorizes the infrastructure financing plan to provide for the division of taxes levied on taxable property in the area included within the district, as specified, and authorizes the public financing authority to issue bonds by adopting a resolution containing specified provisions, including a determination of the amount of tax revenue available or estimated to be available for the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the bonds.\n\nExisting law, the Second Neighborhood Infill Finance and Transit Improvements Act, or NIFTI-2, authorizes a city, county, or city and county to adopt a resolution, at any time before or after the adoption of the infrastructure financing plan for an enhanced infrastructure financing district, to allocate tax revenues of that entity to the district, including revenues derived from local sales and use taxes imposed pursuant to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law or transactions and use taxes imposed in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, if certain conditions are met, including that the boundaries of the enhanced infrastructure financing district are coterminous with the city or county that established the district. \n\nThis bill would revise NIFTI-2 to instead authorize, for resolutions adopted under that act's provisions on or after January 1, 2026, a city, county, or city and county to adopt a resolution, at any time before or after the adoption of the infrastructure financing plan for an enhanced infrastructure financing district, to allocate property tax revenues, and to remove the authorization for adoption of a resolution that allocates revenues derived from local sales and use taxes imposed pursuant to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law or transactions and use taxes. The bill would also repeal the condition that the boundaries of the enhanced infrastructure financing district are coterminous with the city or county that established the district.\n\n(2) Existing law authorizes certain local agencies to establish or form various planning and land use authorities for specified purposes, including, among others, infrastructure, affordable housing, and economic revitalization.\n\nThis bill would authorize the County of Los Angeles to establish a Resilient Rebuilding Authority for the Los Angeles Wildfires to coordinate, accelerate, and streamline recovery in jurisdictions impacted by the January 2025 wildfires, and would authorize the county to empower the authority to engage in specified acts in order to support the rebuilding and protection of homes, businesses, utilities, and other public infrastructure, as provided.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Second Neighborhood Infill Finance and Transit Improvements Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
