{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB144", "title": "Health.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Health"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various healing arts practitioners by boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law provides an exemption from these requirements for a health care practitioner licensed in another state who offers or provides health care for which the practitioner is licensed during a state of emergency, as defined, and upon request of the Director of the Emergency Medical Services Authority, as specified.\n\nThis bill would exempt health care practitioners licensed in another state, territory, or country from certain healing arts licensure, certification, or registration requirements, as described above, while providing professional services at Olympic and Paralympic activities, as defined, if the health care practitioner has been invited by the Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games to provide those services and the committee provides specified information to the Director of Consumer Affairs. The bill would specify that the exemption applies while the health care practitioner is providing professional services at the invitation of the committee and only during the time sanctioned by the committee.\n\nThis bill would authorize the official team representative who is responsible for any member participating in Olympic and Paralympic activities to give consent to the furnishing of professional services to a team member who, due to age, disability, or injury, is not able to personally consent in the event the consent of a parent, guardian, or legal representative of a team member cannot be obtained. The bill would specify that in the case of emergency, the consent of the parent, guardian, or legal representative of the team member would not be necessary in order to authorize the performance of professional services.\n\n(2) Existing law sets forth various powers and responsibilities for the State Department of Public Health concerning communicable disease prevention and control, in relation to persons, animals, and places, as necessary to protect or preserve the public health.\n\nThis bill would require that the list of immunizations, items, and services that were recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) , the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that were in effect on January 1, 2025, serve as a baseline of recommendations and would authorize the State Department of Public Health, notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, to modify or supplement those baseline recommendations, as specified. The bill would require the department to publish recommendations and any updates, modifications, or supplements. \n\n(3) Existing law authorizes various healing arts licensees, including dentists, doctors of podiatric medicine, optometrists, and pharmacists, to independently prescribe, initiate, or administer specified immunizations approved or authorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration in compliance with specified recommendations, including those by the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize those licensees to prescribe, initiate, or administer specified immunizations in a manner consistent with a recommendation made by the State Department of Public Health, as specified. \n\n(4) Existing law provides for the licensure, registration, and regulation of clinical laboratories and various clinical laboratory personnel by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law requires the fees or charges accompanying an application for the issuance or renewal of these licenses, among others, to be adjusted annually by the percentage change printed in the Budget Act and determined by dividing the General Fund appropriation to Laboratory Field Services in the current state fiscal year by the General Fund appropriation to Laboratory Field Services in the preceding state fiscal year. Commencing January 1, 1995, upon establishment of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Fund, existing law requires this annual adjustment to be determined by dividing the current fiscal year appropriation to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Fund by the General Fund appropriation to Laboratory Field Services of the department in the preceding fiscal year. Existing law also requires these fees and charges to be adjusted annually by a percentage determined by dividing the total amount of federal funds available for all programs in Laboratory Field Services of the department during the federal fiscal year ending on September 30 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the change in fees, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete the above provisions pertaining to the annual adjustment of fees or charges and replace them with a requirement that the annual adjustment be done by the department to cover the estimated licensing program costs.\n\nExisting law requires a tissue bank, as defined, to have a current and valid tissue bank license. Under existing law, the application and annual renewal fee for a tissue bank license is $950, adjusted annually by a percentage listed in the Budget Act.\n\nThis bill would adjust the fees or charges for a tissue bank license annually pursuant to the provision above requiring the annual adjustment be done by the department to cover the estimated licensing program costs.\n\nThis bill would additionally revise the application, registration, and license fees for clinical laboratories and clinical laboratory personnel.\n\n(5) Existing federal law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) , requires each state to establish an American Health Benefit Exchange to facilitate the purchase of qualified health benefit plans by qualified individuals and qualified small employers. PPACA defines a \"qualified health plan\" as a plan that, among other requirements, provides an essential health benefits package. Existing state law creates the California Health Benefit Exchange, also known as Covered California, to facilitate the enrollment of qualified individuals and qualified small employers in qualified health plans as required under PPACA. Existing law establishes the Health Care Affordability Reserve Fund to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for health care affordability programs operated by the Exchange.\n\nIf a qualified health plan is required to cover state-mandated gender-affirming care benefits determined to be in addition to essential health benefits, this bill would require the Exchange to provide payments to issuers of qualified health plans to defray the costs of offering those benefits for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, subject to an appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the Health Care Affordability Reserve Fund to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for these payments.\n\n(6) Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, duties relating to the licensing and regulation of various entities, including clinics. Existing law exempts specified clinics from these licensure requirements, including, among others, certain federal clinics, clinics maintained as outpatient departments of hospitals, and student health centers operated by public institutions of higher education.\n\nThis bill would exempt from the above-described licensure requirements a clinic approved by, and that provides health care services at locations designated or sanctioned by, the Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games from May 15, 2028, to September 15, 2028, inclusive.\n\n(7) Existing law, the Emergency Medical Services System and the Prehospital Emergency Medical Care Personnel Act, establishes the Emergency Medical Services Authority, which is responsible for the coordination of various state activities concerning emergency medical services (EMS) , including, among others, establishing minimum standards and promulgating regulations for the training and scope of practice for an Emergency Medical Technician I and II (EMT-I and EMT-II) and Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedic (EMT-P) . Existing law requires the authority to have a chief medical officer who is required to provide clinical leadership and oversight concerning treatment, education, and other matters involving medical decisionmaking and delivery of patient care.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding any other law, would exempt from the EMS licensure, certification, or accreditation requirements of this state an EMT-I, EMT-II, EMT-P, or similar EMS provider, as defined, licensed or certified in another state or territory of the United States, who provides EMS for which they are licensed, if they are authorized by the chief medical officer of the authority to provide EMS at sites in this state sanctioned by the Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games and associated with the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The bill would require the chief medical officer to authorize those EMS personnel based on system needs and informed by committee needs, qualifications of the emergency medical services personnel, and public safety considerations. The bill would prohibit EMS providers authorized by the chief medical officer from being liable for any act or omission taken in good faith while providing authorized services. The bill would require authorization pursuant to these provisions to be valid from May 15, 2028, to September 15, 2028, inclusive, or until authorization is otherwise withdrawn by the chief medical officer.\n\n(8) Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to annually report to certain legislative committees, and publicly post, a summary of outcome and expenditure data with regard to outcome measures for alcohol and drug program services, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal the above-described reporting and publication provisions. \n\n(9) Existing law requires DHCS to provide certain legislative committees with biannual updates on caseload, estimated expenditures, and related program monitoring data for the Every Woman Counts (EWC) Program, as specified. Existing law requires that expenditures for the EWC Program included in the department's budget for services provided on or after July 1, 2017, be charged against the appropriation for the fiscal year in which the billing is paid.\n\nThis bill would delete the above-described requirements relating to the EWC Program. \n\n(10) Existing law establishes the public policy of the state that pupils are advised to adhere to current immunization guidelines, as recommended by, among other entities, the ACIP. Existing law prohibits the governing authority of a school or other institution from unconditionally admitting any person as a pupil unless, before the person's admission to that institution, the person has been fully immunized against various diseases, including any disease deemed appropriate by the State Department of Public Health, taking into consideration recommendations of various entities, including the ACIP. Existing law requires a medical exemption form and the appeal process for revocation of a medical exemption to be consistent with specified guidelines, including those by the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would delete certain references to the ACIP and replace other references to the ACIP with the State Department of Public Health. Some of these provisions would be operative beginning July 1, 2026. To the extent that this bill imposes new duties on a local education agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\n(11) Existing law, from October 1 to the following April 1, inclusive, of each year, requires specified health facilities to offer immunizations for influenza and pneumococcal disease to residents or inpatients 65 years of age or older who are receiving services at the facility, based upon the latest recommendations of specified entities, including the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would replace those references to ACIP with the State Department of Public Health.\n\nExisting law requires the State Department of Public Health to post on its internet website educational information regarding influenza in accordance with the latest recommendations of the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would replace the reference to ACIP with the State Department of Public Health. \n\n(12) Existing law, the Hereditary Disorders Act, requires the State Department of Public Health to license genetic counselors and temporary genetic counselors who meet specified requirements. Existing law prohibits the license fee from exceeding $200 for an original license, license renewal, or temporary license. Existing law requires all moneys collected by the department under the act to be deposited in the Genetic Disease Testing Fund, which is continuously appropriated to the department to carry out the purposes of the act.\n\nThis bill would instead set the fee for an original license, license renewal, and temporary license at $300. The bill would authorize the department to adjust those fees to an amount not to exceed $500. The bill would require the department to solicit input from affected stakeholders before raising these fees. By authorizing additional moneys to be deposited into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(13) Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care, and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires specified health care service plan contracts, or specified disability or health insurance policies, to cover an evidence-based item, service, or immunization that has in effect a specified rating in the recommendations of the USPSTF or an immunization that has in effect a recommendation from specified entities, including the ACIP. Existing law also requires specified health care service plans or disability insurers to offer benefits for the comprehensive prevention care of children consistent with the most current version of the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule/United States, jointly adopted by various entities, including the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would require those health care service plan contracts or disability or health insurance policies to cover an evidence-based item, service, or immunization that had in effect on January 1, 2025, a specified rating in the recommendations of USPSTF. The bill would replace references to the ACIP with the State Department of Public Health. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\n(14) Existing federal law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) , requires each state to establish an American Health Benefit Exchange to facilitate the purchase of qualified health benefit plans by qualified individuals and qualified small employers. Existing state law creates the California Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) , also known as Covered California, for this purpose. PPACA generally prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion services, but if a qualified health plan provides abortion coverage, PPACA requires the issuer of the plan to collect specified amounts from each enrollee and deposit those funds into a segregated account to be used to pay for abortion services. Under state law, the Exchange makes those payments to qualified health plans on behalf of enrollees. Existing state law requires a health care service plan that provides a qualified health plan through the Exchange to report to the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care the total amount of funds maintained in a segregated account.\n\nThis bill would establish the Abortion Access Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, to provide funding for abortion services, including for abortion services funded through grants to provide abortion access. The bill would authorize the Department of Health Care Access and Information to distribute moneys in the fund through grants and contracts. Under the bill, contracts, grants, and related information would be exempt from public disclosure. From the 2025\u201326 fiscal year to the 2028\u201329 fiscal year, inclusive, the bill would require the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care to order a health care service plan that provides a qualified health plan through the Exchange to transfer to the Abortion Access Fund up to the total amount previously funded by the Exchange, not to exceed a specified percentage of the ending balance in its segregated account, and would require a plan to complete the transfer. Because a willful violation of the bill's requirements relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\n(15) Under existing law, the Breast Cancer Fund consists of the Breast Cancer Research Account and the Breast Cancer Control Account. Under existing law, revenues from a specified cigarette tax are deposited into the fund and divided equally between the 2 accounts, to be allocated upon appropriation.\n\nExisting law requires any entity funded by the Breast Cancer Control Program to collect data and maintain records that are determined by the State Department of Public Health to be necessary to facilitate the department's ability to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the entities and the program. Existing law requires the department to submit an annual report to the Legislature and any other appropriate entity.\n\nThis bill would switch the jurisdiction from the State Department of Public Health to DHCS for purposes of the above-described and other related provisions. The bill would make certain changes to the required contents of the report.\n\nExisting law requires the State Department of Public Health to provide for breast cancer screening services at the level of funding budgeted from state and other resources during the fiscal year in which the Legislature has appropriated funds to the department for this purpose, with administrative or indirect costs not exceeding certain limits.\n\nThis bill would delete those provisions. \n\n(16) Existing law establishes the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, administered by the California Health and Human Services Agency and its departments, as applicable. Under existing law, the purpose of the initiative is to transform the state's behavioral health system into an innovative ecosystem in which all children and youth 25 years of age and younger, regardless of payer, are screened, supported, and served for emerging and existing behavioral health needs.\n\nExisting law requires DHCS, or a contracted vendor, to provide competitive grants to qualified entities to build partnerships, capacity, and infrastructure supporting ongoing school-linked behavioral health services, among other purposes, for children and youth 25 years of age and younger. For these purposes, existing law requires the department to develop and maintain a school-linked statewide fee schedule for outpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment provided to a student who is 25 years of age or younger at a schoolsite. Existing law requires the department to develop and maintain a school-linked statewide provider network of schoolsite behavioral health counselors. Existing law authorizes the department to contract with an entity to administer the school-linked statewide behavioral health provider network. Existing law requires that administrator to, among other things, create and administer a process for the submission and reimbursement of eligible claims.\n\nThis bill would require the department to convene a working group twice each year of specified stakeholders, including, among others, behavioral health providers and local educational agencies, to discuss the status of, and receive feedback regarding, the implementation of the fee schedule. The bill would require a contracted administrator to automate the matching of student records with health plan enrollment information and to reimburse claims pursuant to claim payment deadlines, as specified. The bill would require the California Health and Human Service Agency to publish a manual to assist a local educational agency with navigating certain federal laws.\n\n(17) Existing law, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, requires all applicants for or recipients of CalWORKs to ensure and provide documentation that each child in the assistance unit who is not required to be enrolled in school has received all age-appropriate immunizations. Existing law requires all applicants and recipients to be given notice of that obligation and for the notice to include specified recommended childhood immunization schedules, as approved by various entities, including the ACIP.\n\nThis bill would remove the reference to the ACIP and replace it with the State Department of Public Health, as specified. \n\n(18) Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by DHCS and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law sets a schedule of benefits that are covered by the Medi-Cal program.\n\nThis bill would require that vaccines and immunizations are covered in accordance with a recommendation from ACIP, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and any modification or supplement to a recommendation adopted by the State Department of Public Health. The bill would make the implementation of this provision contingent to the extent that federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals are obtained. \n\n(19) Existing law prohibits the use of an assets or resources test for individuals whose income eligibility for Medi-Cal is determined based on the application of a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) . Existing law prohibits, until January 1, 2026, the use of resources to determine Medi-Cal eligibility for applicants or beneficiaries whose eligibility is not determined using the MAGI-based financial methods, subject to receipt of any necessary federal approvals.\n\nUnder existing law, operative on January 1, 2026, for those applicants or beneficiaries whose eligibility is not determined using the MAGI-based financial methods, DHCS is required to seek federal approval to implement a disregard of $130,000 in nonexempt property for a case with one member and $65,000 for each additional household member, up to a maximum of 10 members. Existing law requires that provision to be implemented only after the Director of Health Care Services determines that systems have been programmed for the disregards and they communicate that determination in writing to the Department of Finance.\n\nThis bill would additionally specify that the above-described implementation condition occur no sooner than January 1, 2026.\n\n(20) Existing law sets forth provisions for the transition of certain children from the former Healthy Families Program to the Medi-Cal program. Existing law requires DHCS to provide monthly status reports to certain legislative committees on the transition, with a final comprehensive report provided within 90 days after completion of the last phase of transition.\n\nThis bill would delete the above-described reporting requirement. \n\n(21) Existing law establishes a program, known as the 250% Working Disabled Program (250% WDP) , under which certain working persons with disabilities are eligible for Medi-Cal benefits based on a net countable income of less than 250% of the federal poverty level and other specified criteria. Existing law requires DHCS to report to the Governor and the Legislature any information that DHCS gathers that may explain the low participation rates in 250% WDP and any recommendations on increasing participation, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal the above-described reporting provision.\n\n(22) The federal Medicaid program prohibits payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law. Existing state law extends Medi-Cal eligibility for the full scope of Medi-Cal benefits to individuals who do not have satisfactory immigration status if they are otherwise eligible for those benefits, with the exception of specified dental benefits for individuals who are 19 years of age or older. Existing law makes an individual who is 19 years of age or older, who does not have satisfactory immigration status, and who applies for Medi-Cal on or after January 1, 2026, eligible only for pregnancy-related services and emergency medical treatment. Existing law, beginning no sooner than July 1, 2026, or July 1, 2027, as specified, requires individuals who do not have satisfactory immigration status, who are not pregnant, and who are 19 to 59 years of age, inclusive, to pay a monthly premium of $30, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThis bill would make certain nonminor dependents and foster youths exempt from the service limitations and monthly premium provisions described above. The bill would require the monthly premium payments described above to begin no sooner than July 1, 2027, and make other technical and conforming changes.\n\n(23) Existing law requires DHCS to implement a process that allows applicants and beneficiaries of certain Medi-Cal programs to self-certify the amount and nature of assets and income without the need to submit income or asset documentation. Existing law requires DHCS to implement the process in 2 phases, with the first phase in 2 counties and the 2nd phase statewide, with each county agreeing to meet all federal requirements for income, resource, and other verifications and to perform determinations and verifications in a timely manner. Existing law requires DHCS to promptly provide certain legislative committees with an evaluation of the process and its impact on the Medi-Cal program.\n\nThis bill would delete certain provisions relating to the 2 phases, including the evaluation requirement.\n\n(24) Existing law, under Medi-Cal provisions, requires DHCS to enter into demonstration contracts with manufacturers of medical supplies for 4 items of its own selection of medical supplies existing on the pharmacy claims processing system, for the purpose of establishing rebates or other cost-saving mechanisms and demonstrating cost savings in the purchase of these medical supplies.\n\nThis bill would repeal those and related provisions. The bill would make conforming changes to other provisions.\n\n(25) Existing law requires DHCS to establish a 2-year pilot program to utilize the federal Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) to identify veterans and their dependents or survivors who are enrolled in the Medi-Cal program and assist them in obtaining federal veteran health care benefits. Existing law requires DHCS to monitor the pilot program, evaluate the outcomes and savings, and provide the fiscal committees of the Legislature with a report on the findings and recommendations.\n\nThis bill would delete the above-described monitoring, evaluation, and reporting requirements.\n\n(26) Existing law, operative until July 1, 2025, requires DHCS to work with stakeholders to conduct a study to identify current requirements for medical interpretation services and make recommendations on strategies that may be employed regarding the provision of medical interpretation services for Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are limited English proficient (LEP) . Existing law requires the department to establish a pilot project to evaluate certain factors, including whether disparities in care are reduced, with respect to LEP Medi-Cal beneficiaries compared with Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are proficient in English. Existing law requires the department to expend up to $5,000,000 for the pilot project pursuant to an appropriation made in the Budget Act of 2019, and makes those funds available for that purpose until June 30, 2025.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of these provisions until July 1, 2026, and make those funds available for expenditure, encumbrance, and liquidation until June 30, 2026. By extending the period of time in which previously appropriated funds are available for expenditure, encumbrance, and liquidation, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(27) Existing law requires the Office of Family Planning within DHCS to submit a biennial report to the Legislature on specified subjects relating to family planning services.\n\nThis bill would instead require the office to post annual reports on its internet website.\n\n(28) Existing law requires the former State Department of Health Services, whose functions were transferred to other departments, to provide certain legislative committees with quarterly updates regarding core activities to improve the Medi\u2011Cal managed care program and county expansion, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal those reporting provisions. \n\n(29) Existing law requires the former State Department of Mental Health, whose functions were transferred to other departments, to provide certain legislative committees with semiannual updates regarding key results and funding for the capital costs associated with development, acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing for individuals with mental illness, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal those reporting provisions. \n\n(30) Existing law authorizes the State Public Health Officer, to the extent allowable under federal law, and upon the availability of funds, to expend moneys from the continuously appropriated AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Rebate Fund for a program to cover the costs of prescribed ADAP formulary medications for the prevention of HIV infection and other specified costs. Existing law authorizes the State Department of Public Health to spend up to $75,000,000 from the ADAP Rebate Fund to support current or eligible HIV services and programs, as specified. Existing law prescribes the allocation of those funds, including by authorizing up to $65,000,000 of that $75,000,000 to be spent to supplement or fund services, programs, or initiatives for which federal funding has been reduced or eliminated and making $9,000,000 available to fund state and local disease intervention specialists.\n\nThis bill would make up to $18,000,000 of the above-described $65,000,000 available for state operations and would make up to $1,640,000 of the above-described $9,000,000 available for state operations. By adding to the purposes for which the ADAP Rebate Fund may be spent, the bill would make an appropriation.\n\n(31) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(32) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\n(33) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
