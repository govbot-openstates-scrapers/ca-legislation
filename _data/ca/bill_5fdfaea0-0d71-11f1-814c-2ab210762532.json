{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB377", "title": "Biomethane procurement targets.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Biomethaneprocurementtargets"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory authority over public utilities, including gas corporations. Existing law requires the commission, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, to consider adopting specific biomethane procurement targets or goals for each gas corporation and core transport agent, as specified. Existing law requires, if the commission adopts specific biomethane procurement targets or goals for each gas corporation and core transport agent, the commission to, among other things, ensure that the biomethane available for any procurement program is either delivered to California through a dedicated pipeline, or through a common carrier pipeline and meets 2 specified requirements related to the injection of the biomethane and specified environmental benefits, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would instead require that biomethane delivered to California through a common carrier pipeline meet either of the specified requirements, rather than both. The bill would also add the displacement of conventional natural gas that results in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as one of the specified environmental benefits, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the commission to consider options to promote the in-state production and distribution of biomethane, including whether to allow recovery in rates of the costs of investments to (1) facilitate direct investment in the procurement and installation of utility infrastructure necessary to achieve interconnection between the natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline network and biomethane generation and collection equipment and of gathering lines for a dairy cluster biomethane project, (2) provide for the installation of utility infrastructure to achieve interconnection with facilities that generate biomethane, and (3) ensure that these investments for infrastructure are prudent and reasonable and provide a direct benefit to, and are in the interests of, all classes of ratepayers.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before June 1, 2026, the commission to allow recovery in rates of the costs of those investments.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or an order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be part of the act and because a violation of a commission action implementing its requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
