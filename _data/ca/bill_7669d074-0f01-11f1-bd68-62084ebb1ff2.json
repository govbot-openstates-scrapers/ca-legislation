Existing law requires Caltrans, in consultation with the California Transportation Commission, to prepare a robust asset management plan to guide selection of projects for the state highway operation and protection program. Existing law requires the commission, in connection with the plan, to adopt targets and performance measures reflecting state transportation goals and objectives.\n\nThis bill would require the targets and performance measures adopted by the commission to include targets and performance measures reflecting state transportation goals and objectives for wildlife connectivity assets that reflect the need for new assets and conditions of existing assets that improve or maintain the connectivity of wildlife crossings. This bill would require Caltrans to include wildlife connectivity assets in the asset management plan.\n\nExisting law declares the intent of the Legislature that Caltrans review the full extent of the state highway system, as currently maintained, in consultation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and with opportunities for the public to provide data input for consideration, to develop a comprehensive approach to address wildlife connectivity needs throughout the state with the goal of implementing measures that protect, conserve, and improve the state's unique wildlife, landscapes, and natural resources.\n\nThis bill would explicitly require Caltrans to undertake this duty.\n\nExisting law requires the Caltrans, in consultation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and other appropriate agencies, to establish an inventory of connectivity needs on the state highway system where the implementation of wildlife passage features could reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions or enhance wildlife connectivity, and to update the inventory on a biennial basis, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead require Caltrans to jointly establish and update this inventory with the Department of Fish and Wildlife."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
