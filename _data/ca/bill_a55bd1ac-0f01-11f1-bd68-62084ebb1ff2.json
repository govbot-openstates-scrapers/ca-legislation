The Medi-Cal program is in part governed by, and funded pursuant to, federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law sets forth various provisions relating to the department determining capitation rates for Medi-Cal managed care plans using actuarial methods and a certain methodology that considers, among other factors, utilization and cost data.\n\nThis bill would require the department, for rates effective on or after January 1, 2027, to require that a Medi-Cal managed care plan operating as a downstream fully or partially delegated subcontractor, as defined, be paid actuarially sound rates developed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial rate development principles and practices. Under the bill, failure to pay the subcontractor in a manner consistent with these provisions would be deemed a violation, constituting an unlawful and unfair business practice, as specified. The bill would afford the contractor the opportunity to enforce these requirements by filing a notice of dispute with the department."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
