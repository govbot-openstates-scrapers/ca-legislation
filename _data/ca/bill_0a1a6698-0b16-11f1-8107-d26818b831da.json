{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB20", "title": "Occupational safety: high-exposure trigger tasks on artificial stone.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Occupationalsafety", "high-exposuretriggertasksonartificialstone"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the Department of Industrial Relations in the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and requires the department to be conducted under the control of an executive officer known as the Director of Industrial Relations. Existing law states that the function of the department, among other things, is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners of California, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment and vests the department with responsibility for administering the state plan for the development and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards relating to issues covered by corresponding standards adopted pursuant to federal law.\n\nExisting law establishes the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board within the department to adopt occupational safety and health standards for the state, including standards dealing with exposure to harmful airborne contaminants. Existing law requires the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the department to enforce all occupational safety and health standards, as specified. A violation of these standards and regulations under specific circumstances is a crime.\n\nExisting law, the California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 (OSHA) , requires employers to comply with certain safety and health standards, as specified, and charges the Division of Occupational Safety and Health with enforcement of the act. OSHA defines \"serious injury or illness\" for purposes of the act to mean any injury or illness occurring in a place of employment or in connection with any employment that results in one of a list of conditions, including inpatient hospitalization, as provided, the loss of a member of the body, any serious degree of permanent disfigurement, and impairment sufficient to cause a part of the body or the function of an organ to become permanently and significantly reduced in efficiency on or off the job, as specified. Under OSHA, certain knowing, negligent, or willful violations of safety and health standards are punishable as a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would add silicosis and silica-related lung cancer to the list of conditions that, if resulting from an injury or illness occurring in a place of employment or in connection with an employment, would constitute a \"serious injury or illness.\" By expanding the scope of a crime under OSHA, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nOSHA creates a rebuttable presumption that a \"serious violation\" exists in a place of employment if the division demonstrates that there is a realistic possibility that death or serious physical harm could result from the actual hazard created by the violation. OSHA defines \"serious physical harm\" for purposes of that provision.\n\nThis bill would expand that definition of \"serious physical harm\" to include silicosis and silica-related lung cancer.\n\nThe bill would impose restrictions on specified high-exposure trigger tasks on artificial stone, as those terms are defined. Specifically, a person or entity engaged in high-exposure trigger tasks would be prohibited from using dry methods, and would be required to use effective wet methods when engaging in any high-exposure trigger tasks. The bill would make a violation of these provisions grounds for, among other disciplinary action, an immediate order by the division prohibiting continued work. The bill would require the division to enforce these provisions by issuing a citation alleging a violation and a notice of civil penalty.\n\nThe bill would require the owner or operator of a fabrication shop, or any individual who will employ another individual to perform high-exposure trigger tasks in a fabrication shop, to ensure that an employee who will perform high-exposure tasks receives specified training and, beginning on July 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, to attest to the division that these employees have been trained. The bill would require the division to enforce these provisions by issuing a citation alleging a violation and a notice of civil penalty.\n\nThe bill would require the State Department of Public Health to consider a report of silicosis related to occupational exposure to artificial stone a serious illness and to report that case to the division. The bill would require the division, if it receives such a report, to subject the employer or place of employment to investigation, as specified. The bill would require the division to notify the State Department of Public Health of any cases of silicosis related to artificial stone identified through enforcement activities. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to conduct specified activities to address silicosis risk exposure in fabrication shops, including providing technical assistance to local health jurisdictions engaged in silicosis surveillance and prevention activities.\n\nThe bill would define various terms for these purposes. The bill would make findings and declarations related to these provisions.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Occupational safety: fabrication activities on stone slab products."}, {"note": "", "title": "Occupational safety: fabrication activities on slab solid surface products."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
