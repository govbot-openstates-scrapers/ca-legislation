Existing law defines an assault weapon, including, among others, as a semiautomatic centrefire firearm, as specified, that has a threaded barrel capable of accepting a silencer. Existing law defines a silencer, among others, as any device or attachment intended to muffle the sound of a firearm.\n\nExisting law makes it a felony for any person, firm, or corporation to possess a silencer for a firearm. Existing law exempts specified actions from those provisions, including the manufacture, possession, transportation, or sale or other transfer of a silencer to specified law enforcement agencies and military or naval forces by dealers or manufacturers registered under federal law.\n\nExisting law authorizes a court to sentence an eligible person convicted of a felony to probation. Existing law prohibits granting probation in specified circumstances, including if the person possesses a silencer.\n\nExisting law requires any weapon, including a firearm and any attachments, that was carried unlawfully for specified crimes to be surrendered to specified law enforcement entities. Existing law requires weapons surrendered pursuant to these provisions to be destroyed by the law enforcement entity.\n\nThis bill would replace the term \"silencer\" with the term \"suppressor\" in the above provisions."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Criminal law: rights of victims and witnesses of crimes."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
