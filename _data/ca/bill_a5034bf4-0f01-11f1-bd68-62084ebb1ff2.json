Existing law creates and authorizes a number of diversion and deferred entry of judgment programs, which either defer entry of a plea of guilty by the defendant or postpone the proceedings of the case as long as the defendant participates in the program. Existing law requires the court to dismiss the plea or charges if the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the program.\n\nThis bill would require the court to order restitution to the victims or victims when a defendant participates in a diversion program, provided that the defendant is informed of their right to have a judicial determination of the amount of restitution and is provided with a hearing, waives a hearing, or stipulates to the amount of restitution ordered. The bill would prohibit a defendant's inability to pay restitution due to indigence or mental disorder from being grounds for denial of diversion or a finding that the defendant failed to comply with the terms of diversion."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
