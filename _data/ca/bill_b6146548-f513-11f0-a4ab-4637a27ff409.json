{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB735", "title": "Planning and zoning: logistics use developments: truck routes.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Planningandzoning", "logisticsusedevelopments", "truckroutes"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, beginning January 1, 2026, prescribes various statewide warehouse design and build standards for any proposed new or expanded logistics use developments, as specified, including, among other things, standards for building design and location, parking, truck loading bays, landscaping buffers, entry gates, and signage. Existing law defines various terms, including \"21st century warehouse,\" and \"tier 1 21st century warehouse,\" for purposes of those provisions as logistics uses that, among other things, comply with specified building and energy efficiency standards, including requirements related to the availability of conduits and electrical hookups to power climate control equipment at loading bays, as specified. Existing law, subject to specified exceptions, defines \"logistics use\" for these purposes to mean a building in which cargo, goods, or products are moved or stored for later distribution to business or retail customers, or both, that does not predominantly serve retail customers for onsite purchases, and heavy-duty trucks are primarily involved in the movement of the cargo, goods, or products.\n\nThis bill would clarify that a 21st century warehouse and a tier 1 21st century warehouse are required to comply with those standards as are in effect at the time that the building permit for a development of a 21st century warehouse is issued and make other clarifying changes relating to permissibility of use of conduits and electrical hookups at loading bays at those locations. The bill would revise the definition of \"logistics use\" and instead define \"logistics use development\" for these purposes to mean a building that is primarily used as a warehouse for the movement or the storage of cargo, goods, or products that are moved to business or retail customers, or both, that does not predominantly serve retail customers for onsite purchases, and heavy-duty trucks are primarily involved in the movement of the cargo, goods, or products. The bill would make various other technical and conforming changes to the provisions governing logistics use development.\n\nExisting law requires a facility operator, before issuance of a certificate of occupancy, to establish and submit for approval by a city, county, or city and county a truck routing plan that, among other things, described the operational characteristics of the use of the facility operator. Existing law requires, by January 1, 2028, a county or city to update its circulation element, as provided, and to provide for posting of conspicuous signage to identify truck routes and additional signage for truck parking and appropriate idling facility locations, as specified. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General to enforce those provisions concerning the circulation element and to impose a fine against a jurisdiction that is in violation of these provisions, as provided.\n\nThis bill would, instead, require that the truck routing plan describe the operational characteristics of the logistics use development and of the logistics use development operator. The bill would require a jurisdiction, except as specified, to adopt a prescribed ordinance, on or before January 1, 2028, including that the ordinance establishes specific travel routes for the transport of goods, materials, or freight for storage, transfer, or redistribution to safely accommodate additional truck traffic and avoid residential areas and sensitive receptors, as provided. The bill would, instead, require a county or city that is located in a warehouse concentration region to update its circulation element, on or before January 1, 2026, as specified. On and after January 1, 2028, or January 1, 2030, as specified, the bill would require that all proposed development of a logistics use development be accessible via arterial roads, major thoroughfares, or roads that predominantly serve commercially oriented uses. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to bring an action against a city, county, or city and county that is in violation of these provisions. The bill would make a city, county, or city and county that has been found by a court to be in violation of these provisions subject to a civil penalty of up to $50,000 every 6 months, accrued from the date of the violation until the violation is cured, specified costs, and other relief deemed appropriate by the court. The bill would require a city or county to provide for posting of conspicuous signage to identify truck routes and additional signage for truck parking and appropriate locations for idling and parking, among other things.\n\nExisting law requires a city, county, or city and county to condition approval of a logistics use development on (1) 2-to-1 replacement of any demolished housing unit that was occupied within the last 10 years, unless the housing unit was declared substandard by a building official, prior to purchase by the developer, and (2) the provision to any displaced tenant with a specified amount if residential dwellings are affected through purchase, as provided.\n\nThis bill would establish that nothing in the provisions described above regarding conditions placed upon approval of a logistics use development shall be construed to preclude the applicability of or compliance with other provisions that, among other things, prohibit an affected city or an affected county, as defined, from approving a development project that will require the demolition of occupied or vacant protected units, as defined, or that is located on a site where protected units were demolished in the previous 5 years, unless specified requirements are satisfied.\n\nExisting law provides for the creation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in those portions of the Counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino included within the area of the South Coast Air Basin, as specified. Existing law requires the district, subject to an appropriation for the express purpose, to deploy mobile air monitoring systems to collect air pollution measurements in communities that are near operational logistics use developments, use the data collected to conduct an air modeling analysis and submit its findings to the Legislature, and establish a process for receiving community input on how specified penalties assessed and collected are spent.\n\nThis bill would delete the requirement that the district use the data collected, as described above, to conduct an air modeling analysis and, instead, based upon the amount of appropriated funds, authorize the district to use a combination of new air monitoring data or other measurement data to evaluate pollutant concentrations, as provided. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes to references to the South Coast Air Quality Management District contained in those provisions.\n\nExisting law creates in the Transportation Agency, the Department of the California Highway Patrol under the control of a civil executive officer known as the Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol. Existing law requires the commissioner to establish a school for the training and education of the members of the California Highway Patrol, and for other employees of the department deemed necessary, in traffic regulation, in the performance of their duties, and in the proper enforcement of codes and laws respecting use of the highways.\n\nThis bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2027, to make specified training on enforcement of laws relating to commercial vehicles, including, but not limited to, truck route enforcement, available to city and county law enforcement agencies, as specified.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: logistics use: truck routes."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
