The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law authorizes the provision of Medi-Cal benefits by a contracted managed care plan and requires that benefits provided by a managed care plan are subject to specified time and distance standards.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer that provides or arranges for the provision of hospital or physician services to comply with specified timely access to care requirements, including ensuring that its network has adequate capacity and availability of licensed health care providers to offer enrollees and insureds appointments that meet specified timeframes. Existing law authorizes the department director to take enforcement action against health care plans that fail to comply with these provisions, including assessing administrative penalties.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before July 1, 2027, the Department of Managed Health Care, the Department of Insurance, and the State Department of Health Care Services to consult together and with stakeholders develop and adopt standards for the geographic accessibility of perinatal units to ensure timely access for enrollees and insureds, as specified. The bill's provisions would become inoperative on July 1, 2033, and would be repealed on January 1, 2034.\n\nBecause a violation by a health care service plan of a standard adopted by the Department of Managed Health Care would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public health: maternity ward closures."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
