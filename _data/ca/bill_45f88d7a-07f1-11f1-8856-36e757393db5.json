{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB918", "title": "Food facilities: retail food safety.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Foodfacilities", "retailfoodsafety"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, establishes uniform health and sanitation standards for retail food facilities, which are primarily enforced by local public health agencies. Violation of the California Retail Food Code is a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided. Existing law limits the size of a passthrough window service opening to 216 square inches, and requires the opening to be provided with a solid or screened window, equipped with a self-closing device. Existing law authorizes a passthrough window of up to 432 square inches if equipped with an air curtain device.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the 216 square inch solid or screened window has to be equipped with a self-closing device. The bill would authorize a passthrough window service opening of up to 432 square inches if equipped with an air curtain device or a self-closing device. The bill would authorize a passthrough window service opening that is larger than 432 square inches if equipped with both a self-closing device and an air curtain device. The bill would authorize an enforcement agency to approve alternative passthrough window or other service openings if the proposed alternative can adequately maintain exclusion of vermin or other means of contamination. The bill would require a passthrough window or other service opening to only be used for drive-thru service functions and would prohibit it from being used as an entrance or exit for employees or customers. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
