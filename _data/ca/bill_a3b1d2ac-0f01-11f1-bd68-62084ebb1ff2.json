Existing law requires a local child support agency to maintain a list of those persons included in certain child support cases. Existing law requires the Department of Child Support Services to consolidate and certify the local child support agency lists and provide the consolidated list to specified state entities that are responsible for the regulation of licenses, including, but not limited to, the Department of Motor Vehicles. Existing law requires those entities, prior to the issuance or renewal of a license, to determine whether the applicant is on the most recent certified consolidated list provided by the department, and authorizes the entity to withhold issuance or renewal of the license of an applicant on the list, as specified. Existing law prohibits the department from including in the list sent to the Department of Motor Vehicles, for the purpose of denying, withholding, or suspending a driver's license, the information of a support obligor whose annual household income is at or below 70% of the median income for the county in which the department or the local child enforcement agency believes the support obligor resides. Commencing January 1, 2027, existing law would only apply this prohibition to noncommercial driver's licenses. \n\nThis bill would expand the prohibition on the department to also prohibit the department from sending the above-described income information to all boards, as defined, that issue a license, certificate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authorization to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, or operate a motor vehicle, for the purpose of denying, withholding, or suspending a license. The bill would make a conforming change."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
