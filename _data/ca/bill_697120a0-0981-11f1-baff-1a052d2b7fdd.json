By expanding the purposes for which those moneys may be used, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would provide that not more than 5% of the moneys in the fund may be used during any fiscal year to augment the budget of the Department of Food and Agriculture to develop and administer an operational and policy framework for the network of California fairs. The bill would require all available funds in the fund to be allocated to the network of California fairs pursuant to an approved expenditure plan no later than December 31 of each calendar year."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
