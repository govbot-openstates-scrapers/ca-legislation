The California Constitution authorizes the Governor to negotiate and conclude those compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature. Existing law expressly ratifies a number of tribal-state gaming compacts, and amendments to tribal-state gaming compacts, between the State of California and specified Indian tribes. \n\nThe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project, as defined, that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment, as defined, or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. \n\nThis bill would ratify amendments between the State of California and the Big Sandy Rancheria of Western Mono Indians of California, executed on December 12, 2024, and February 12, 2025, to extend the terms of the existing tribal-state gaming compact, executed on September 10, 1999. The bill would also ratify a new tribal-state gaming compact entered into between the State of California and the Big Sandy Rancheria of Western Mono Indians of California. The bill would provide that, in deference to tribal sovereignty, certain actions related to these compacts are not projects for the purposes of CEQA. \n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Tribal gaming: compact amendment ratification."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
