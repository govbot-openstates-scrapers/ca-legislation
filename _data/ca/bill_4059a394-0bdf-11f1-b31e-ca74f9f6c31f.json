Existing law establishes community college districts throughout the state, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at the community college campuses they operate and maintain. Existing law provides for a formula for the calculation of general purpose apportionments of state funds to community colleges. Existing law provides a separate formula for the allocation of apportionments of state funds to community colleges, which uses the numbers of full-time equivalent students as its basis, for use for apportionments for noncredit instruction and instruction in career development and college preparation. Existing law specific the noncredit courses, noncredit classes, and support services that are eligible for state apportionment.\n\nThis bill would require the board of governors to allocate base funding for designated categorical programs to noncredit colleges, as defined, and noncredit centers, as defined, that meet specified conditions. The bill would specify that the categorical programs eligible for those base funding allocations include, but are not limited to, disabled student programs and services, mental health services, and veteran resource centers. The bill would require the board of governors, in consultation with the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, to determine the methodology for allocating the base funding."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
