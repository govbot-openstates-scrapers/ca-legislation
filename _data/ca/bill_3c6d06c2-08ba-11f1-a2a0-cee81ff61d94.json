Existing law exempts from this requirement certain transfers such as those made by gift, bequest, intestate succession, or operation of law, among others. Existing law requires a person who receives a firearm pursuant to these provisions to submit to the Department of Justice a report, as prescribed by the department, describing the firearm and providing personal information. Existing law requires, for a firearm purchase when the register is used, 2 copies of the original sheet of the register containing certain information to be mailed to the department, and when the electronic or telephonic transfer of applicant information is used, the record of applicant information be transmitted to the department by electronic or telephonic transfer. Existing law requires that fees charged by the department for the processing of these forms be deposited in the Dealers' Record of Sale Special Account, which is available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to offset certain costs relating to the regulation of firearms, among other things.\n\nThis bill would, beginning July 1, 2027, require the department to mail to each purchaser of a firearm, within 10 days of the application, or any person who notifies the department pursuant to the above-described reports of a firearm transaction, within 10 days of the notification, a letter that includes certain information relevant to firearm ownership, such as information on how to legally transfer or relinquish a firearm and resources regarding gun violence restraining orders, among others."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
