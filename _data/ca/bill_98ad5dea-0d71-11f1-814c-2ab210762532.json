{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB970", "title": "Child abuse and neglect reporting.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Childabuseandneglectreporting"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, establishes procedures for the reporting and investigation of suspected child abuse or neglect. The act requires certain professionals, including specified health practitioners and social workers, known as \"mandated reporters,\" to report by telephone known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to a local law enforcement agency or a county welfare or probation department, as specified.\n\nExisting law authorizes a county welfare agency to develop a program for internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect, as specified. Existing law authorizes a mandated reporter in a county where the program is active to use the internet-based reporting tool in lieu of the required initial telephone report.\n\nThis bill would authorize the County of Los Angeles to establish a 2-year pilot program to test a new model for the mandatory reporting of child abuse or neglect. The bill would require the pilot program to include a comprehensive County of Los Angeles mandated reporter training that may be made available to all mandated reporters in the county. The bill would require the pilot program to also include the development and deployment of an internet-based decision-support tool, developed through a collaborative process with, among others, the State Department of Social Services, for mandated reporters who have completed that training. The bill would require the decision-support tool to, among other things, make a recommendation on whether or not to report and would prohibit the decision-support tool from using predictive analysis. The bill would, during the time the pilot program is in effect, deem a mandated reporter to have satisfied their reporting duties if the reporter completed the training, used the decision-support tool, and complied with the recommended action. The bill would shield a mandated reporter who satisfied their reporting duties pursuant to these provisions from civil liability or criminal penalty, and from penalties impacting their professional licenses, credentials, and certifications, for failing to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect, as well as the reporter's supervisor, employer, superior, or principal, as specified. The bill would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2030.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
