Existing state law requires the State Department of Social Services to identify the necessary elements of a county disaster plan, to issue guidance to county human services agencies, and to offer training on Disaster CalFresh, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the department to provide to an affected county, upon request, support necessary for out-stationed application intake locations to support timely, adequate, and safe access to Disaster CalFresh during or following a disaster. Existing law also requires the department to maintain and make available to affected counties, free of charge, technology and equipment to support the mobile issuance of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards to recipients of Disaster CalFresh or replacement benefits.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the department to inquire of the ability of each county facility that serves CalFresh participants in the impacted area to provide timely and adequate service. To the extent that the bill would create new duties for counties to provide Disaster CalFresh-related information to the department, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
