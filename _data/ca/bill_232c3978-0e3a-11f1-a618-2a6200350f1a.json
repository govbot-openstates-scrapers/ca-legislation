Under existing law, the substances in Schedule I are deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use while substances in Schedules II through V are substances that have an accepted medical use, but have the potential for abuse. Existing law restricts the prescription, furnishing, possession, sale, and use of controlled substances, and makes a violation of those laws a crime, except as specified. Existing law defines drug paraphernalia and prohibits, among other things, the manufacture, sale, and possession, as specified, of drug paraphernalia. Existing law excludes from these prohibitions any testing equipment that is designed, marketed, used, or intended to be used to analyze a substance for the presence of fentanyl, ketamine, gamma hydroxybutyric acid, or any analog of fentanyl.\n\nThis bill would add xylazine to the list of Schedule III substances, as specified. If an animal drug containing xylazine that has been approved under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is not available for sale in California, the bill would create an exception for a substance that is intended to be used to compound an animal drug, as specified. The bill would exclude from the prohibitions on paraphernalia any testing equipment to analyze a substance for the presence of xylazine. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
