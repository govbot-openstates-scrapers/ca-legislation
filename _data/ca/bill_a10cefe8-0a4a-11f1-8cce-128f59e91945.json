Existing law authorizes the department to also to impose civil penalties for violations of the act. Existing law gives residents of those facilities specified rights, including, but not limited to, the right to be free from neglect, financial exploitation, involuntary seclusion, and verbal, mental, or physical abuse. \n\nExisting law, the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act, establishes various procedures for the reporting, investigation, and prosecution of elder and dependent adult abuse and defines various forms of abuse, such as abandonment, isolation, and financial abuse.\n\nThis bill would require the department, when it substantiates a violation of the act that constitutes abuse in violation of a resident's rights, to categorize the type of abuse using the definitions from the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act. The bill would require that the category of abuse be listed on public-facing database maintained by the department."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
