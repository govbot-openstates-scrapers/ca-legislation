Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine, for each current fiscal year, for each school district in the state, the total number of administrative employees and the total number of teachers, except as provided, the total maximum number of administrative employees that should be employed by the school district based upon the application of the appropriate ratio prescribed by law, and the number of administrative employees in excess of the number allowable without penalty, as provided. Existing law requires the Superintendent to determine a reduction in state support resulting from excess administrative employees, as specified, and requires the school district's 2nd principal apportionment for the current fiscal year to be reduced by that amount. Existing law exempts the Paradise Unified School District from that reduction in state support for the 2021\u201322 fiscal year to the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, inclusive.\n\nThis bill would further exempt the Paradise Unified School District from that reduction in state support for the 2024\u201325 fiscal year to the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, inclusive. The bill would require the Paradise Unified School District to, by September 1, 2026, submit a report related to the administrative employee-to-teacher ratio to the Superintendent, the Department of Finance, and the appropriate budget and policy committees of both houses of the Legislature, as specified. By imposing additional reporting requirements on the Paradise Unified School District, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Paradise Unified School District.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
