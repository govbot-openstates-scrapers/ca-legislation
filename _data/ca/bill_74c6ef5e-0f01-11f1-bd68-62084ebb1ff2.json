Existing law establishes childcare resource and referral programs to serve a defined geographic area and provide prescribed services, including, making referrals to licensed child daycare facilities and the provision of childcare navigators to support children in foster care, children previously in foster care upon return to their home of origin, and children of parents involved in the child welfare system, including any child who meets the eligibility criteria for the Emergency Child Care Bridge Program for Foster Children.\n\nThis bill would authorize childcare navigators to refer foster children to the county welfare department for eligibility and approval under the Emergency Child Care Bridge Program for Foster Children, and would require participating county welfare departments to determine eligibility of that referred child for the program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
