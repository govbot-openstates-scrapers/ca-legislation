Existing law requires management to, when a mobilehome tenancy is terminated due to damage or destruction as a result of a disaster, return to the homeowner any advance rental payments, as provided, and discharges a homeowner's obligation to pay rent for the period during which the homeowner is required to be evacuated due to a mandatory evacuation order pursuant to a disaster.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would support mobilehome park communities that are damaged or destroyed by a natural or manmade disaster."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
