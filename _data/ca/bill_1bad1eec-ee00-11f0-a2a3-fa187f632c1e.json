Existing law requires the department, on and after July 1, 2030, to enforce and ensure compliance with those provisions and regulations, as provided. Existing law requires manufacturers of these products, on or before July 1, 2029, to register with the department, to pay a registration fee to the department, and to provide a statement of compliance certifying compliance with the applicable prohibitions on the use of PFAS to the department, as specified. Existing law authorizes the department to test products and to rely on third-party testing to determine compliance with prohibitions on the use of PFAS, as specified. Existing law requires the department to issue a notice of violation for a product in violation of the prohibitions on the use of PFAS, as provided. Existing law authorizes the department to assess an administrative penalty for a violation of these prohibitions and authorizes the department to seek an injunction to restrain a person or entity from violating these prohibitions, as specified. \n\nThis bill would, beginning January 1, 2027, prohibit a person from distributing, selling, or offering for sale artificial turf, carpets or rugs, cleaning products, cookware, dental floss, fabric treatments, or upholstered furniture that contain intentionally added PFAS, as defined. The bill would authorize the department to adopt regulations to designate additional consumer product categories to prohibit the distribution, selling, or offering for sale of consumer products containing intentionally added PFAS within those consumer product categories if the department determines that safer alternatives, as defined, are readily available at comparable costs. The bill would prohibit the department from adopting a regulation that prohibits a consumer product containing intentionally added PFAS from distribution, sale, or offering for sale on or before 18 months after the regulation is adopted. The bill would define \"product\" for purposes of these provisions to not include, among other things, used products offered for sale, federally approved drugs or medical devices, or products containing fluoropolymers, as specified. \n\nThis bill would require these prohibitions on consumer products to be enforced by the department pursuant to the existing authority described above, including, but not limited to, the authority relating to registration, product testing, and administrative penalties."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Hazardous substances: prohibitions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
