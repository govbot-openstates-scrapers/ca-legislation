The bill would establish the California Affordable Child Care Fund in the State Treasury and would direct all revenues, less reimbursement to the Franchise Tax Board for the administration of the additional tax, to be deposited into that fund. The bill would continuously appropriate the moneys in the fund to the State Treasurer for the purpose of establishing a grant program for licensed child care facilities, as described. By establishing a new continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.\n\nThis bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 23 of the membership of each house of the Legislature."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Affordable Childcare Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
