Existing law requires the initial board of directors of the Imperial Valley Healthcare District to be appointed from and by specified bodies, including among others, the Imperial County Board of Supervisors, the Pioneers Memorial Healthcare District Board of Directors, and the Heffernan Memorial Healthcare District Board of Directors. Following the appointment of the initial board of directors, existing law requires the board of directors to adopt a resolution to divide the Imperial Valley Healthcare District into voting districts for the purpose of electing members of the board of directors from and by the electors of those voting districts. Existing law prohibits a member of the initial board of directors from being eligible to become an elected board member of a district for the first round of elections. \n\nThis bill would instead authorize a member of the initial board of directors to become the first elected member for a voting district if the member is otherwise eligible for the position and is elected by the electors of that voting district."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
