Existing law provides for the deposit of various moneys, including revenues from certain fuel taxes and vehicle fees, for the program into the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Account. Existing law requires funds available for the program to be allocated for various specified purposes and requires the remaining funds available for the program to be continuously appropriated, with 50% for allocation to the Department of Transportation and 50% for apportionment to cities and counties by the Controller. Of the funds to be apportioned to cities and counties, existing law requires the Controller to apportion 50% of those funds to counties pursuant to a specified formula and 50% of those funds to cities in the proportion that the total population of each city bears to the total population of all the cities in the state.\n\nThis bill would require the Controller, with respect to the revenues apportioned to cities, to apportion a minimum of $200,000 to each city, regardless of its population size, in the 2027\u201328 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
