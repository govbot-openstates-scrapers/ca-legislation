The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) , among other things, consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis activities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Cannabis Control. Existing law authorizes local jurisdictions to enforce the provisions of MAUCRSA and to regulate cannabis businesses, as specified.\n\nPrior existing law, which was repealed on January 1, 2025, established a task force on state and local regulation of commercial cannabis activity to promote communication between state and local entities engaged in the regulation of commercial cannabis activity and facilitate cooperation to enforce applicable state and local laws, consisting of specified members from state agencies and all local jurisdictions regulating commercial cannabis activity that opt to participate. That prior law exempted the meetings of the task force from the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the Ralph M. Brown Act.\n\nThis bill would reinstate the task force and expand the task force to include representatives from tribal governmental entities regulating commercial cannabis activity that opt to participate in the task force. The bill would exempt the meetings of the task force from the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the Ralph M. Brown Act.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
