However, existing law authorizes a sexual assault victim to request that a kit collected from them not be tested and prohibits a kit for which this request had been made from being tested.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize a sexual assault survivor who is 18 years of age or older and who is undecided whether to report to law enforcement at the time of an examination to request that all medical evidence collected from them not be tested. If the request is made at the time of the examination, the bill would prohibit the medical facility from submitting the kit to a crime laboratory and would require the investigating agency to retain the kit until the sexual assault survivor requests testing. If the request is made after the examination, the bill would either require the investigating agency to retain the kit or would require the crime laboratory to return the kit to the investigating agency to be retained. The bill would also authorize a sexual assault survivor who has requested that their kit not be tested to later request that it be tested. By creating a new duty for local investigating agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Planning and zoning: annual progress report: Low Barrier Navigation Centers."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
