Existing law establishes the Advanced Air Mobility, Zero-Emission, and Electrification Aviation Advisory Panel to assess the feasibility and readiness of existing infrastructure to support a vertiport network to facilitate the development of advanced air mobility services, the development of a 3-year prioritized workplan for the state to advance advanced air mobility services, and pathways for promoting equity of access to advanced air mobility infrastructure, as specified. Existing law requires the department, not later than January 1, 2025, to report to the Legislature on the infrastructure feasibility and readiness study and the 3-year prioritized workplan.\n\nThis bill, the Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure Act, would require the department to take certain actions related to advanced air mobility, as defined, including, among other things, developing a statewide plan, or updating the statewide aviation plan, to include vertiports, electric aviation charging, and the infrastructure needs of other advances in aviation technology, and designating a subject matter expert for advanced air mobility within the department, as specified. The bill would prohibit its provisions from being construed to (1) interfere with or suspend the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration or any other federal department or agency, or state zoning laws or regulations, as specified, or (2) limit or interfere with the jurisdiction, authority, rights, or responsibilities of any airport sponsor or operator, as specified.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, applies to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the State Aeronautics Act is a crime.\n\nBecause the above provisions would be part of the State Aeronautics Act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
