Existing law vests the government of the district in a board of directors comprised of 7 directors, one from each ward, and 2 elected at large. Existing law requires a nomination paper for a candidate seeking election to a directorship to be signed by 50 voters, if seeking to be elected by ward, and by 100 voters, if seeking to be elected at large. Existing law provides 4-year terms for directors, as specified. Existing law contains obsolete requirements governing the term lengths for directors elected at the initial election following the formation of the district. \n\nThis bill would eliminate directors at large and would instead require all 7 directors to be elected from wards. The bill would specify the terms of office for the directors elected at the November 3, 2026, and November 7, 2028, statewide general elections. The bill would repeal the obsolete provisions governing the initial election. To the extent this bill would increase the district's duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law authorizes compensation of no more than $1,000 per month for each director and authorizes the board of directors to adjust this monthly compensation based upon the percentage increase in the California Consumer Price Index for each calendar year following the operative date of the last adjustment, as provided. Existing law prohibits the adjustment from becoming effective until the next regular election of the directors following adoption of the adjustment.\n\nThis bill instead would authorize the board to adjust the monthly compensation based upon the percentage increase in the California Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year. The bill instead would prohibit the adjustment from becoming effective until the first day of the new fiscal year following adoption of the adjustment.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
