Existing law requires the department to comment, within 30 days of receiving the analysis, on the extent to which the analysis adheres to specified regulations.\n\nThis bill would require the State Air Resources Board to also prepare and publish a supplemental standardized regulatory impact analysis if the proposed regulation is materially changed after release of the initial standardized regulatory impact analysis described above, and before adoption, that updates the consumer cost analysis to reflect amendments made during the rulemaking process. The bill would require the board to make the supplemental standardized regulatory impact analysis available for public review."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
