Existing law requires, in every independent adoption proceeding under these provisions, the prospective adoptive parent or parents to file with the court either an adoption request within 10 working days after execution of an adoption placement agreement, or a guardianship petition within 30 calendar days after the child's discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier.\n\nThis bill would instead require the prospective adoptive parent or parents in that case to file with the court either an adoption request within 7 working days after execution of an adoption placement agreement, or a guardianship petition within 30 calendar days after the child's discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
