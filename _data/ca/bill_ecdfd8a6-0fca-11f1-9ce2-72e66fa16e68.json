For purposes of this limitation, \"full cash value\" is defined as the assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975\u201376 tax bill under \"full cash value\" or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing property tax law defines \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" to mean any addition to real property since the last lien date and any alteration of land or of any improvement since the last lien date that constitutes a major rehabilitation thereof or that converts the property to a different use. Existing property tax law, in the case of real property that has been damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity, excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" any timely reconstruction of the real property, or portion thereof, where the property after reconstruction is substantially equivalent to the property prior to damage or destruction.\n\nThis bill would define \"substantially equivalent\" for these purposes to include when the size of the improvement after reconstruction does not exceed 110% of the size of the improvement before damage or destruction. The bill would apply this change to lien dates occurring on or after January 1, 2025, for real property that serves as replacement property for property that was damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity on or after January 1, 2025. By imposing additional duties on local tax officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations related to a gift of public funds.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\nExisting law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
