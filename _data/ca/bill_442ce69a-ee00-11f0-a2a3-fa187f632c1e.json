Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders under the same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions, as specified. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or health insurer to use utilization review to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity.\n\nThis bill would require a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of physical conditions and diseases under the same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions, as specified. The bill would require the delivery of medically necessary services out of network if those services are not available within geographic and timely access standards. The bill would require a plan or insurer to apply specified clinical criteria and guidelines in conducting utilization review of the covered health care services and benefits for physical conditions and diseases. The bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care or the Insurance Commissioner, as applicable, to assess administrative or civil penalties, as specified, for violation of the requirements relating to utilization review. Because a willful violation of these requirements relative to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nUnder existing law, a health care service plan or managed care entity has a duty of ordinary care to arrange for the provision of medically necessary health care services to its subscribers or enrollees and is liable for all harm legally caused by its failure to exercise that ordinary care when the failure resulted in the denial, delay, or modification of the health care service recommended for, or furnished to, a subscriber or enrollee and the subscriber or enrollee suffers substantial harm, as defined.\n\nThis bill would define \"medically necessary health care service\" for purposes of the above-described provision to mean legally prescribed medical care that is reasonable and comports with the medical community standard.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health care service plan: managed care entity: duty of care."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
