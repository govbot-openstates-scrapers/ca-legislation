{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB245", "title": "Property taxation: application of base year value: disaster relief.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Propertytaxation", "applicationofbaseyearvalue", "disasterrelief"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, \"full cash value\" is defined as the assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975\u201376 tax bill under \"full cash value\" or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing law defines \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" to mean any addition to real property since the last lien date and any alteration of land or of any improvement since the last lien date that constitutes a major rehabilitation thereof or that converts the property to a different use. Existing law, where real property has been damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity, excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" any timely reconstruction of the real property, or portion thereof, where the property after reconstruction is substantially equivalent to the property prior to damage or destruction. Existing law, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, authorizes the transfer of the base year value of property that is substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as declared by the Governor, to comparable replacement property within the same county that is acquired or newly constructed within 5 years after the disaster, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes the owner of property substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as declared by the Governor, to apply the base year value of that property to replacement property reconstructed on the same site of the damaged or destroyed property within 5 years after the disaster if the reconstructed property is comparable to the substantially damaged or destroyed property, determined as provided.\n\nThis bill would extend the 5-year time period described above by 3 years if the property was substantially damaged or destroyed by the 2025 Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, Hurst Fire, Lidia Fire, Sunset Fire, or Woodley Fire on or after January 7, 2025, but before February 1, 2025. The bill would make these provisions applicable to the determination of base year values for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year and fiscal years thereafter. By imposing additional duties on local tax officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing property tax law authorizes counties to adopt ordinances that allow assessees whose property was damaged or destroyed to apply for a reassessment of that property if certain conditions, including the filing of an application for reassessment, are met. \n\nThis bill would require that, in the case of property impacted by the 2025 Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, Hurst Fire, Lidia Fire, Sunset Fire, or Woodley Fire, the fair market value of that real property on January 1, 2025, takes into account any reduction in value to that property due to damage, destruction, depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property, or other factors causing a decline in value.\n\n(3) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the public purpose served by these provisions.\n\n(4) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 70.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by SB 663 to be operative only if this bill and SB 663 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\n(6) Existing law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\n(7) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Property taxation: disaster victims."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
