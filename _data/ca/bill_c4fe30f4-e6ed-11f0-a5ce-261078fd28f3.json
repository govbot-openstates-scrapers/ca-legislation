Existing law requires a person, in registering their water use to the board, to set forth a certification that the registrant has contacted the Department of Fish and Wildlife and to include a copy of any conditions required by the department.\n\nThis bill would authorize any person to also obtain a right to appropriate water for a small restoration use, as defined. The bill would also authorize a person to apply for a restoration management permit from the Department of Fish and Wildlife, as provided, and if the permit is issued, the person would be required to include a copy of any conditions required by the restoration management permit with the required certification.\n\nExisting law exempts certain stream segments subject to certain minimum streamflow requirements from the provisions of the act upon proper registration.\n\nThis bill, if the Director of Fish and Wildlife establishes proposed streamflow requirements for a stream segment, as specified, would instead prohibit the authorization of a registration for that stream segment until the board establishes instream flow requirements as a part of the general conditions applicable to that stream segment. The bill would require that the establishment of those instream flow requirements be done after the board considers the proposed streamflow requirements, if proposed by the director."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Water rights: small irrigation use."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
