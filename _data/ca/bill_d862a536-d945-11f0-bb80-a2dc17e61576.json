The act authorizes the state board to include in its regulation of those emissions the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Existing law continuously appropriates 25% of the annual proceeds of the fund to the High-Speed Rail Authority for certain purposes, as specified.\n\nThis bill would eliminate the continuous appropriation of 25% of the annual proceeds of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the High-Speed Rail Authority on June 30, 2026. The bill, beginning with the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, and until December 31, 2030, would require 25% of the annual proceeds of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to be transferred to the Motor Vehicle Fuel Account.\n\nExisting law, the Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax Law, imposes a tax upon each gallon of motor vehicle fuel removed from a refinery or terminal rack in this state, entered into this state, or sold in this state, at a specified rate per gallon. Existing law provides that amounts received pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax Law are deposited into the Motor Vehicle Fuel Account in the Transportation Tax Fund. Existing law transfers the portions of those motor vehicle fuel tax revenues attributable to various off-highway uses of motor vehicle fuel to specified funds and transfers the remaining revenues to the Highway Users Tax Account for allocation to various state and local transportation purposes consistent with the expenditure restrictions imposed by Article XIX of the California Constitution on excise tax revenues from fuels used in motor vehicles on the highway.\n\nThis bill, beginning July 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, would reduce the rate of the tax imposed upon each gallon of fuel by a specified percentage based annually on the amount transferred to the Motor Vehicle Fuel Account from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. By transferring moneys to a continuously appropriated account, this bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Transportation: bicycles."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
