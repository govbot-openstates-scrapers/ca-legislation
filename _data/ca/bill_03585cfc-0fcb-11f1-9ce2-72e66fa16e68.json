{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB943", "title": "Public utilities: electricity: transmission charge: industrial transition usage.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Publicutilities", "electricity", "industrialtransitionusage", "transmissioncharge"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. \n\nThis bill would authorize the commission to direct an electrical corporation with more than 100,000 service connections in California, when billing an industrial customer for separately metered new load to provide industrial process heat, to apply an adjustment factor to the per kilowatthour rate so as to limit the nonbypassable charge ratio, as specified, in furtherance of facilitating electrification of industrial energy use.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or an order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause the above provision would be part of the act and a violation of a commission action implementing that provision would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nExisting law establishes the Independent System Operator as a nonprofit, public benefit corporation and requires the Independent System Operator, among other duties, to ensure the efficient use and reliable operation of the electrical transmission grid consistent with the achievement of planning and operating reserve criteria, as provided.\n\nThis bill would establish as a policy of the state that allocation of costs to ratepayers for transmission and distribution resources should follow cost causation principles. The bill would require the commission, on or before January 1, 2028, to develop recommendations for changes to high voltage transmission access charges that would improve consistency with the commission's causation principles, to communicate the recommendations to the Independent System Operator, and to request the Independent System Operator to reopen its transmission access charge structure enhancements proceeding to consider reforms to its high-voltage transmission access charges.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
