The bill would define \"targeted attack\" as a criminal offense that is motivated by the victim's status as a journalist or intended to interfere with a journalist in the performance of their work as a journalist. If the underlying offense is a felony, the bill would create an enhancement punishable by an additional term of one, two, or three years imprisonment, as provided. The bill would authorize a court to strike any additional term imposed by this section if the court determines that there are mitigating circumstances and states on the record the reasons for striking the additional punishment.\n\nBy creating a new sentencing enhancement, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
