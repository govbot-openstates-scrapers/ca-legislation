The Sales and Use Tax Law provides various exemptions from those taxes.\n\nThis bill would, until January 1, 2032, exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale in this state of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, over-the-counter medication, as defined.\n\nExisting law requires a bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would make findings detailing the goals of the above-described tax expenditure and performance indicators for determining whether the tax expenditure meets those goals. \n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.\n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by this bill does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes.\n\nExisting law imposes or dedicates certain state sales and use tax rates for local funding, including through the Local Revenue Fund 2011.\n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by this bill does not apply to those state sales and use tax rates imposed or dedicated for local government funding, including those rates for which revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011.\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
