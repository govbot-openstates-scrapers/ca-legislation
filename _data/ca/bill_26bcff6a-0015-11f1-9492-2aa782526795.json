Under the program, the University of California assesses legislation proposing to repeal or mandate a benefit or service requirement on health care insurance plans or health insurers. Under the program, the University of California provides a written analysis that includes, among other data, financial impacts of legislation on publicly funded state health insurance programs, including the Medi-Cal program and the Healthy Families Program. Existing law imposes an annual charge on health care service plans and health insurers for the 2022\u201323 to 2026\u201327 fiscal years, inclusive, as specified, to be deposited into the fund. Existing law prohibits the total annual assessment on health care service plans and health insurers from exceeding $2,200,000. Under existing law, the fund and the program become inoperative on July 1, 2027, and are repealed as of January 1, 2028.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of the California Health Benefit Review Program and the Health Care Benefits Fund through July 1, 2033, and would authorize the continued assessment of the annual charge on health care service plans and health insurers for that purpose for the 2026\u201327 to 2032\u201333 fiscal years, inclusive. The bill would increase the allowable total annual assessment on health care service plans and health insurers to $3,200,000. The bill would remove the Healthy Families Program as an example of the publicly funded state health insurance programs within an analysis of financial impacts of legislation.\n\nThis bill would make these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2033, and would repeal it as of January 1, 2034.\n\nThis bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 23 of the membership of each house of the Legislature."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
