{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB303", "title": "Battery energy storage facilities.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Batteryenergystoragefacilities"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, until June 30, 2029, authorizes a person proposing an eligible facility, including an energy storage system capable of storing 200 megawatthours or more of energy, to submit an application for certification with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission of the site and related facility. Existing law specifies that the issuance by the commission of the certificate is in lieu of any permit, certificate, or similar document required by any state, local, or regional agency, or federal agency to the extent permitted by federal law, except as provided. Existing law establishes the procedures by which the commission is to review the application.\n\nThis bill would specify that energy storage systems do not include battery energy storage systems for the above-described purposes. The bill would require the commission to deny applications for a battery energy storage system that are pending as of the effective date of the bill.\n\nExisting law, the Planning and Zoning Law, sets forth various requirements relating to the review of development project permit applications and the issuance of development permits for specified classes of development projects. \n\nThis bill would prohibit the authorization of a development project that includes a battery energy storage system capable of storing 200 megawatthours or more of energy if the development project is located within 3,200 feet of a sensitive receptor or is located on an environmentally sensitive site, as specified.\n\nBy modifying the duties of local agencies with regard to the approval of development projects that include a battery energy storage system, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
