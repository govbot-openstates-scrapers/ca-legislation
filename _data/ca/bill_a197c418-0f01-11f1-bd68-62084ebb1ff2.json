Existing law requires the department, subject to an appropriation for these purposes, to provide a grant to a county office of education to acquire a training program identified by the department and disseminate that training program at no cost to specified educational entities, as specified.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast these provisions by (1) deleting the requirement to provide the above-described grant, (2) deleting the requirement of the department to identify the above-described evidence-based online training program, (3) instead requiring the Behavioral Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission to develop an online training program to train school staff, parents, and pupils of county offices of education, school districts, state special schools, and charter schools that serve pupils in kindergarten or in any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, on pupil suicide prevention, as specified. The bill would require those educational entities that elect to conduct suicide risk screenings to report data on these screenings to the department, as provided, and would require the department to compile and post statewide aggregate data on these screenings on its internet website, as provided."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
