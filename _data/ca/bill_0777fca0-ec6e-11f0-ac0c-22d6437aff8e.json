The bill would authorize a court to grant injunctive relief to remedy a violation or threatened violation of this requirement, and would entitle a prevailing plaintiff who obtains injunctive relief to reasonable attorney's fees and costs."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
