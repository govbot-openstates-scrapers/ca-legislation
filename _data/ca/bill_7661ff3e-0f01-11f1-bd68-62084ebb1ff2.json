Among those provisions, existing law requires the operator to permit a minor who is a registered user to remove content or information that the user posted on the operator's internet website, online service, online application, or mobile application, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require a social media platform to provide a mechanism by which a child influencer can, after reaching 18 years of age, request their parent, legal guardian, or family member to edit or delete content that features the child influencer as a minor and for which the parent, legal guardian, or family member received compensation for sharing on the platform, as specified. The bill would require the parent, legal guardian, or family member to delete or edit the content so that the child influencer is no longer featured within 10 business days of receiving the notification of the request. The bill would authorize a child influencer to bring a specified civil action against a parent, legal guardian, or family member who violates the bill."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
