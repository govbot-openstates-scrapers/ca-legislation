Existing law defines an eligible entity, for purposes of the program, as a nonprofit organization, as specified, or a city, county, or city and county.\n\nThis bill would, to the extent permitted by federal law, prohibit any Chiquita Canyon elevated temperature landfill event payment amount received by a taxpayer from being considered income or resources when determining eligibility or benefit amounts for any means-tested program or guaranteed income payments, as defined. To the extent that the bill would expand eligibility for programs administered by counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations related to a gift of public funds.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
