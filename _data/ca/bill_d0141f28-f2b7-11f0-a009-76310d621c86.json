The bill would require, on or before June 1, 2027, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, regional water control boards, and the Department of Pesticide Regulation to collaborate on active studies related to the effectiveness of low-leach-rate paint and elevated copper concentrations in saltwater harbors, bays, and marinas that are primarily a result of the use of copper-based antifouling paint, and would require the Department of Pesticide Regulation to finish and release these studies. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2028, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the State Resources Control Board, and the Department of Pesticide Regulation to collaborate to determine the best methods to address elevated copper concentrations in saltwater harbors, bays, and marinas that are primarily a result of the use of this paint in the state.
