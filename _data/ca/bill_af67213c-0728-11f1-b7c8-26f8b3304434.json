{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB508", "title": "Residential care facilities for the elderly: direct care ratios.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Residentialcarefacilitiesfortheelderly", "directcareratios"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law, the California Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly Act, requires the State Department of Social Services to license, inspect, and regulate residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFEs) , as defined, and imposes criminal penalties on a person who violates the act or who willfully or repeatedly violates any rule or regulation adopted under the act.\n\nThis bill would require each RCFE to calculate a direct care ratio, as defined, and maintain records of its direct care ratios for a minimum of 12 months. The bill would require RCFEs to disclose its direct care ratios to residents or to the resident's representatives upon admission and any time there is a rate increase, as specified. The bill would require these disclosures to be provided in writing and signed by the resident, the resident's representative, or the licensee or an employee of the licensee, as specified, to confirm receipt. The bill would require copies of the signed disclosure to be provided to the resident or the resident's representative. The bill would require each RCFE to make its direct care ratios available to the public by specified means, including, among others, by posting the daily direct care ratio on the facility's internet website. The bill would require the RCFE's internet website and any literature or internet website used to advertise the RCFE and the level of care provided by that facility to include a statement that direct care ratios are calculated on a daily basis, that direct care ratios are available to the public upon request for any given day within the prior 12 months, and that direct care ratios are required to be disclosed to residents or their representatives at the points of time described above. The bill would require each RCFE to post the daily direct care ratio in locations visible to all residents, including, but not limited to, the lunchroom or lobby of the facility. By expanding the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
