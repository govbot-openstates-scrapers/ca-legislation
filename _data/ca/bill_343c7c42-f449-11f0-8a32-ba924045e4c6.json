The act authorizes the commission to waive the filing fee for an application for a coastal development permit.\n\nThis bill would clarify the commission is authorized to also waive the filing fee for an application for a coastal development permit amendment. The bill would authorize the commission to, when the commission waives the filing fee for an application for a coastal development permit or permit amendment for a project meeting certain criteria, specify whether the waiver also applies to future applications for an amendment to the permit. The bill would also make various nonsubstantive changes and update erroneous cross references.\n\nExisting law, the Marine Invasive Species Act, requires the State Lands Commission, in consultation with specific entities, to biennially submit to the Legislature a report that includes certain information, including, among other things, a summary of the information provided in the ballast water discharge report forms submitted to the commission, as provided. \n\nThis bill would require the biennial report submitted to the Legislature to instead be submitted triennially and would require that report to instead include a summary of the information provided in the ballast water management report forms submitted to the commission, as provided. The bill would require the commission to publish on its internet website, on or before April 30, 2026, and updated semiannually, a summary of the information provided in those ballast water management report forms, as provided, and inspection and compliance rates for vessels, as available."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Marine Invasive Species Act: biennial reports: semiannual updates."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
