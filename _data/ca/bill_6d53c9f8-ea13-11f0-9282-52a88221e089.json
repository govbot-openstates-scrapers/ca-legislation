Existing law authorizes the East Bay Regional Park District, the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, and the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District to exchange up to 40 acres of district-owned park or open-space land in a calendar year.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize the exchange of park or open-space land by a 23 vote of the board, and would authorize the East Bay Regional Park District when a compatible and comparable exchange is not feasible, to accept compensation in an exchange with a public agency, provided that compensation is used to purchase park and open-space land. The bill would authorize the above-listed districts to exchange up to 80 acres of district-owned land in a calendar year.\n\nThis bill would make other changes related to park and open-space districts, including, among others, repealing specified authorizations and requirements regarding the East Bay Regional Park District.\n\nExisting law generally authorizes the general manager of a regional park, park and open space, and open-space district, with district board approval, to bind the district, in accordance with board policy, and without advertising, for the payment for supplies, materials, labor, or other valuable consideration for any purpose in amounts not exceeding $50,000. Existing law authorizes the district, by action of the board in an open meeting, to increase the amount by which the general manager of the district may bind the district above that limit.\n\nThis bill would authorize a general manager of a district with a population of 200,000 or more, with the approval of the board, to bind the district, in accordance with board policy that has been adopted in an open meeting, for the payment for equipment, supplies, and materials for any purpose, including new construction of a building, structure, or improvement, excluding labor and services, when the annual aggregate cost does not exceed $150,000, as provided.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the East Bay Regional Park District."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Park, park and open-space, and open-space districts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
