Existing law requires every manufacturer of, importer of, or dealer in any pesticide, except as specified, to obtain a certificate of registration from the Department of Pesticide Regulation before the pesticide is offered for sale. Existing law requires the Director of Pesticide Regulation to endeavor to eliminate from use in the state pesticides that endanger the agricultural or nonagricultural environment, among other things, and in carrying out this responsibility, to develop an orderly program for the continuous evaluation of all pesticides actually registered, as specified. \n\nThis bill would require, on or before January 1, 2029, the Department of Pesticide Regulation to complete a reevaluation of copper-based antifouling boat paint products, and to make the determination to retain, modify, or suspend its standards or to place new appropriate standards on the chemical composition or use of copper-based antifouling paints. The bill would require, on or before June 1, 2028, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, regional water control boards, and the Department of Pesticide Regulation to collaborate on active studies related to the effectiveness of low-leach-rate paint and elevated copper concentrations in saltwater harbors, bays, and marinas that are primarily a result of the use of copper-based antifouling paint, and would require the Department of Pesticide Regulation to finish and release these studies. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2029, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the State Resources Control Board, and the Department of Pesticide Regulation to collaborate to determine the best methods to address elevated copper concentrations in saltwater harbors, bays, and marinas that are primarily a result of the use of this paint in the state. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2029, the California Environmental Protection Agency to post on its internet website these best methods."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
