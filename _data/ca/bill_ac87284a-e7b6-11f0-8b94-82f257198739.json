Existing law requires these regulations to include, among other things, provisions for the granting of licenses and permits for the manufacture, wholesale, import, export, and sale of all classes of fireworks. Existing law authorizes the State Fire Marshal to deny or revoke a fireworks license for specified reasons. A violation of the State Fireworks Law or the regulations issued pursuant thereto is a misdemeanor.\n\nExisting law requires fireworks licensees seeking authorization for specified activities related to fireworks to submit a written application for a permit to the chief of the fire department or the chief fire prevention officer of the city or county, or to another issuing authority that may be designated by the governing body of the city or county, or, in the event there is no officer or person appointed within the area, to the State Fire Marshal or the State Fire Marshal's deputy, as provided.\n\n This bill would require a fireworks licensee to provide to the State Fire Marshal documentation affirming the possession of a permit applicable to fireworks activity and necessary local land use permits or other entitlements, as required by the public agency having local jurisdiction, and information about the storage sites for the fireworks. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the State Fire Marshal to revoke the fireworks license of a licensee who fails to provide this documentation or information and to deny a license to a license applicant who fails to provide this documentation or information, as provided. The bill would also require the State Fire Marshal to both allow the applicable public agency an opportunity to validate the permit or entitlement assertions of the licensee and to furnish a copy of any applicable license to the public agency, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes the State Fire Marshal to deny the application for a license or the application for renewal of a license filed by a person who has been convicted of a felony involving explosives or dangerous fireworks or who has been convicted as a principal or accessory in a crime against property involving arson or any other fire-related offenses, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the State Fire Marshal to deny the application for a license or the application for renewal of a license to a person under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime that is both (A) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and (B) a violent crime or an offense the commission of which creates a threat to public safety.\n\nExisting law requires an import or export fireworks licensee to file a notice with the State Fire Marshal before the arrival of any class of fireworks subject to the license held by the licensee.\n\nThis bill would require an import or export fireworks licensee to additionally provide the above-described notice to the local jurisdiction listed as the destination for the fireworks. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Land use: economic development: surplus land."}, {"note": "", "title": "Planning and Zoning Law: general plan: land use element."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
