The bill would limit the credit allowed to $3,500 per taxable year. \n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
