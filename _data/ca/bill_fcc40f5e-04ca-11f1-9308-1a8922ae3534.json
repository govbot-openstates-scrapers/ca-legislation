Existing law authorizes operators of toll facilities on federal-aid highways engaged in an interoperability program to provide, regarding a vehicle's use of the toll facility, only the license plate number, transponder identification number, date and time of the transaction, and identity of the agency operating the toll facility.\n\nThis bill would instead authorize an operator of a toll facility on federal-aid highways engaged in an interstate interoperability program to provide to an out-of-state toll agency or interstate interoperability tolling hub only the information regarding a vehicle's use of the toll facility that is license plate data, transponder data, or transaction data, and that is listed as \"required\" by specified national interoperability specifications. If the operator needs to collect other types of information to implement interstate interoperability, the bill would prohibit the operator from selling or otherwise providing that information to any other person or entity, as specified. If the operator transmits those other types of information to an out-of-state toll agency or any interstate interoperability tolling hub, the bill would subject the operator to an action by the affected person for no less than $2,500 per violation, as specified. The bill would require a transportation agency that participates in interstate interoperability to post those national interoperability specifications data types on their internet website. The bill would repeal these provisions relating to an interstate interoperability program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
