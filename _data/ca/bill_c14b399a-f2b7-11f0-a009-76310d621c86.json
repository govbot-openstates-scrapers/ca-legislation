Existing law defines the term \"target population\" for purposes of requirements applicable to the housing element to include certain persons, including persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities and individuals eligible for specified developmental disability services.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of the term \"target population\" for the purposes of requirements applicable to the housing element, as described above, to include victims of domestic violence, as specified. By imposing additional requirements on local governments with regard to their housing element, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
