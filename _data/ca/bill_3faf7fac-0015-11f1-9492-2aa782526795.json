Existing law specifies that a covered claim is governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located when the transfer is made or the obligation is incurred. Existing law specifies, for purposes of these provisions, that a debtor's location, if the debtor is an individual, is the individual's principal residence.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that a debtor's location, if the debtor is an individual, is the debtor's principal residence or domicile."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
