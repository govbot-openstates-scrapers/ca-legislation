The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\n Existing federal Medicaid law requires the state to publish an online directory of physicians and, at state option, other providers, as specified. Existing state law sets forth Medi-Cal managed care provisions relating to a Medi-Cal applicant or beneficiary being informed of the health care options available regarding methods of receiving Medi-Cal benefits, including through certain provider directories. The department has administratively created an online provider directory through an internet website known as Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Care Options.\n\nThis bill would require, as part of the health care options information posted by the department, in the provider directory that lists accepted Medi-Cal managed care plans, through the Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Care Options internet website and any other applicable mechanisms, that the directory include skilled nursing facilities as one of the available searchable provider types. The bill would require that this provision be implemented in conjunction with implementation of the above-described provisions. The bill would require the department to annually update that provider directory to ensure that information is accurate and readily accessible to the public."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
