Existing law prohibits the board from reinstating the certificate of a person under specified circumstances relating to the commission of sexual misconduct or sexual offenses.\n\nThis bill would require automatic revocation of a person's certificate if the certificate was revoked based on a finding by the board that the person committed one of those specified acts or offenses and the certificate was subsequently reinstated by the board on or after January 1, 2020.
