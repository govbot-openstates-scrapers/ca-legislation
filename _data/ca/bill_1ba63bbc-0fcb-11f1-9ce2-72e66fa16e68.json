Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to initiate communication with the 911 emergency system with the intent to annoy or harass another person.\n\nThis bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation of these provisions punishable as a misdemeanor or felony for a person who was 18 years of age or older at the time the person committed the prior offense or offenses. By increasing the penalty for existing crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law makes an individual convicted of the crimes described above liable to a public agency for the reasonable costs of an emergency response by the public agency.\n\nThe bill would extend those liability provisions to property damage incurred as a result of the emergency response.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
