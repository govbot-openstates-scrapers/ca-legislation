{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1188", "title": "Elections: statewide initiative and referendum petitions: disclosures.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Elections", "disclosures", "statewideinitiativeandreferendumpetitions"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires the inclusion of an Official Top Funders disclosure with any petition proposing certain types of ballot measures, including a state initiative or referendum, for which the circulation is paid for by a committee, as defined. Existing law requires a petition to include a notice informing a person to sign only if it is the same month for which the Official Top Funders disclosure is applicable or if the person has seen the disclosure for that month.\n\nThis bill would require a state initiative or referendum petition to also include a notice informing a person to sign only if they have reviewed the Official Top Funders disclosure. The bill would require each section of a state initiative or referendum petition to include a space for signers to check a box to confirm that they have read the Official Top Funders disclosure.\n\nUnder existing law, the ballot label for a statewide measure contains a condensed version of the ballot title and summary prepared by the Attorney General, including a fiscal impact summary prepared by the Legislative Analyst, followed by a listing of the names of the measure's supporters and opponents. Existing law requires a committee primarily formed to support or oppose a state ballot measure or state candidate that raises $1,000,000 or more for an election to disclose the committee's top 10 contributors on the Fair Political Practices Commission's website, until the Secretary of State certifies a particular online filing and disclosure system, at which point the contributors would be disclosed on the Secretary of State's website.\n\nThis bill would require the 3 largest contributors to all committees formed in support of a statewide initiative or referendum measure, the 3 largest contributors to all committees formed in opposition to the measure, and the address for the website identifying committees' top 10 contributors to also be printed on the ballot immediately following the names of the measure's supporters and opponents. The Secretary of State would be required to make a copy of the top contributors available for public examination prior to printing that information on ballots, and voters would be authorized to seek a writ of mandate requiring the identified contributors to be amended or deleted.\n\nThe bill would apply its provisions only to proposed statewide initiative or statewide referendum measures for which the Attorney General delivers a circulating title and summary to the proponents on or after the effective date of the bill. To the extent the bill would increase the duties of county elections officials relative to examining initiative and referendum petitions and printing ballots, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Certification of voting systems."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
