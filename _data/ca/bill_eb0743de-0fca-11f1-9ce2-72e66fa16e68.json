{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB1167", "title": "Vehicles: electric bicycles.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Vehicles", "electricbicycles"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law defines an electric bicycle as a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric motor that does not exceed 750 watts of power. Existing law classifies electric bicycles into 3 classes with different restrictions for various purposes, and requires, among other things, a class 3 electric bicycle to be equipped with a speedometer. Existing law prohibits certain vehicles that do not meet the definition of an electric bicycle from being advertised, sold, offered for sale, or labeled as an electric bicycle, as specified. A violation of the Vehicle Code is a crime.\n\nThis bill would amend the type of vehicles that are prohibited from being advertised, sold, offered for sale, or labeled as electric bicycles, including, among others, motor-driven cycles and mopeds. The bill would additionally make a violation of this provision a misleading statement for purposes of false advertising provisions of the Business and Professions Code. By creating new crimes related to the advertisement, sale, offer, and labeling of electric bicycles, and by expanding the application of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law defines a motor-driven cycle as any motorcycle with a motor that displaces less than 150 cubic centimeters.\n\nThe bill would revise the definition of motor-driven cycle to mean any motorcycle propelled by an internal combustion engine that displaces less than 150 cubic centimeters, or by an electric motor of less than 3,750 watts that produces 5 brake horsepower or less.\n\nExisting law defines a motorized bicycle or moped as a two-wheeled or three-wheeled device having fully operative pedals for propulsion by human power, or having no pedals if powered solely by electrical energy, and an automatic transmission and a motor that produces less than 4 gross brake horsepower, and is capable of propelling the device at a maximum speed of not more than 30 miles per hour on level ground.\n\nThis bill would delete references to motorized bicycle in the Vehicle Code and replace the term with \"moped.\" The bill would revise the definition of a moped to mean a two-wheeled or three-wheeled device that has an electric motor or an internal combustion engine that produces less than 4 gross brake horsepower, is capable of propelling the device at a maximum speed of not more than 30 miles per hour on level ground, is designed for highway use, complies with all applicable federal motor safety standards, and meets all the equipment requirements of the Vehicle Code. The bill would specify that a moped may be equipped with operable pedals for propulsion by human power.\n\nExisting law requires every manufacturer of a motorized bicycle or moped to provide a specified disclosure to buyers.\n\nThe bill would instead require every manufacturer, importer, or seller of a motor-driven cycle or moped that is powered by an electric motor to provide a specified disclosure to all potential buyers in any advertising, including any online advertising on internet websites or social media. The bill would additionally make a violation of this provision a misleading statement for purposes of false advertising provisions of the Business and Professions Code. By creating new crimes related to disclosure requirements on manufacturers, importers, or sellers of motor-driven cycles and mopeds, and by expanding the application of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law defines an off-highway motor vehicle as a motor vehicle that operates on lands, other than a highway, that are open and accessible to the public, as specified. Existing law establishes rules for the operation of an off-highway vehicle. Existing law requires every off-highway motor vehicle that is not registered under the Vehicle Code to display an identification plate or device issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, except as specified.\n\nThe bill would explicitly clarify that off-highway electric motorcycles are subject to identification as an off-highway motor vehicle. The bill would also prohibit the use, allowing to use, or operating an off-highway electric motorcycle, motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, or moped powered by an electric motor on any forest-covered land, brush-covered land, or grass-covered land unless the vehicle has been certified by an accredited independent laboratory, as specified, and the name or mark of the certifying laboratory is permanently marked on the vehicle or on its drive system. By creating new crimes related to the operation of off-highway vehicles, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would make other clarifying and conforming changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
