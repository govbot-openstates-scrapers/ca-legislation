Existing law requires each special education local plan area to ensure that a continuum of program options is available to meet the needs of individuals with exceptional needs for special education and related services, as required by federal law. Existing law requires the continuum of program options to include, among other options, a resource specialist program, designated instruction and services, and special classes, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the resource specialist program to provide, among other things, monitoring of pupil progress on a regular basis, participation in the review and revision of individualized education programs, as appropriate, and referral of pupils who do not demonstrate appropriate progress to the individualized education program team. Existing law requires caseloads for resource specialists to be stated in specified local policies and in accordance with regulations established by the State Board of Education, and prohibits a resource specialist from having a caseload that exceeds 28 pupils.\n\nThis bill would require local educational agencies to take all reasonable steps to distribute the workload associated with initial assessments across all resource specialists employed by the local educational agency in an equal manner, unless otherwise collectively bargained. By imposing additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law requires special classes that serve pupils with similar and more intensive educational needs to be available, and authorizes special classes to enroll pupils only when the nature or severity of the disability of the individual with exceptional needs is such that education in the regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services, including curriculum modification and behavioral support, cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\n\nThis bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or before July 1, 2027, to recommend a maximum adult-to-pupil staffing ratio for those special classes, as provided, and to post the recommendation on the department's internet website. The bill would require the Superintendent to report their recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature and the state board on or before April 1, 2027, as specified.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Special education."}, {"note": "", "title": "Special education: caseload limits: pupil-to-teacher ratios: Special Education Teams."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
