{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1117", "title": "Electricity: rates: optional dynamic rate tariffs.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Electricity", "optionaldynamicratetariffs", "rates"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires each electrical corporation to identify a separate rate component to fund certain programs that enhance system reliability and provide in-state benefits, and requires that the rate component be a nonbypassable element of the local distribution service.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, through a new or existing proceeding, to develop optional dynamic rate tariffs applicable to each large electrical corporation for the large electrical corporation's customers. The bill would require at least one optional dynamic rate tariff for each segment of medium and large commercial and industrial customers on or before July 1, 2028, and at least one optional dynamic rate tariff for each segment of residential and small commercial customers on or before July 1, 2030. The bill would require each optional dynamic rate tariff to include, at minimum, a time-varying distribution rate that reflects dynamic grid constraints, a time-varying generation rate that reflects wholesale market conditions, and nonbypassable charges, as specified. The bill would require the commission to ensure, among other things, any overcollection of transmission-, distribution-, and generation-related revenue requirements from participating bundled customers is returned to the participating bundled customers and any undercollection of those revenue requirements is borne by those same customers. The bill would additionally require that any overcollection of transmission- or distribution-related revenue requirements from unbundled customers be returned to the same unbundled customers, and any undercollection of those revenue requirements be borne by those same customers. The bill would require that any customer of an electrical corporation with an installed smart meter who chooses to take service under an optional dynamic rate tariff be provided access to their own interval usage data directly from the smart meter as that data is generated, as provided. The bill would also require the commission to determine whether each large electrical corporation would be required to allow medium and large commercial and industrial customers taking service under an optional dynamic rate tariff to also participate in supply-side resource demand response programs, as provided. The bill would require the commission to consider rules or conditions on participation by vulnerable residential customers to ensure adequate protection for those customers, as provided. The bill would require the commission to incorporate the load shift and load reduction effects of dynamic rate adoption in proceedings on revenue requirement cost recovery, as provided. The bill would require the commission to ensure load-serving entities provide adequate electricity bill comparison information to residential and small business customers interested in taking service under an optional dynamic rate tariff.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
