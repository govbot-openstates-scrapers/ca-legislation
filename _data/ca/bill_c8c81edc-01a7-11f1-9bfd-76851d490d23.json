Existing law makes it a felony to possess material with the intent to make a destructive device or explosive without obtaining a permit to do so.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person from operating a robotic device, as defined, equipped or mounted with a weapon, as defined. The bill would make a violation an infraction punishable by a fine of at least $100 but not more than $2,000. The bill would exclude specified persons, including a government official acting within the scope of their employment and a person acting within the scope of their employment by an organization that is researching, developing, testing, or manufacturing the robotic device for government use, if the person can demonstrate that they are researching, developing, testing, or manufacturing the robotic device for that purpose. By creating a new infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
