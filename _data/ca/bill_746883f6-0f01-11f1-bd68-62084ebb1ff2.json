By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law defines extortion as the obtaining of property or other consideration from another, with their consent, or the obtaining of an official act of a public officer, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right. Existing law excludes from this provision a person under 18 years of age who has obtained consideration consisting of sexual conduct or an image of an intimate body part.\n\nThis bill would except from that exclusion cases where the minor has knowingly threatened, intimidated, or coerced another minor to cause any physical harm, engage in any sexual conduct, or obtain an image of an intimate body part from another minor, including an image of an intimate body part that is produced by artificial intelligence. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
