Existing law requires a restaurant that sells a children's meal that includes a beverage to make the default beverage water, sparkling water, or flavored water, as specified, or unflavored milk or a nondairy milk alternative, as specified. A violation of the code's provisions related to children's meals is an infraction. \n\nThis bill would require a chain restaurant, as defined, that sells a children's meal to offer at least one children's meal that meets specified minimum nutrition standards, including, among others, that the meal not contain more than 550 calories and that the meal include at least 2 servings of specified types and quantities of food. The bill would also require the chain restaurant to include an icon or symbol on the menu to identify the children's meal that meets those requirements. The bill would require a chain restaurant that sells a children's meal, on or before July 1, 2026, to include information to its employees on how to comply with those requirements.\n\nBy creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
