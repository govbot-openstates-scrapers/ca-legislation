In this regard, existing law prohibits a provision waiving the consumer's right to make any statement regarding the seller, lessor, or its employees or agents, or concerning the goods or services. Existing law also prohibits a consumer service contract from limiting a consumer's ability to file a complaint with a licensing board that regulates the consumer service provider or to participate in the board's investigation into the consumer service provider, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, for a consumer use agreement, limit the dispute resolution terms and conditions to the use, payment, or provision of the good, service, money, or credit provided by the consumer use agreement. The bill would make a waiver of these provisions void and unenforceable, as provided, and would require that the provisions be liberally construed for the purpose of protecting consumers. The bill would provide that the duties and obligations it imposes are cumulative with, and do not limit or expand, duties and obligations imposed under any other law, and do not limit any rights or remedies under any other law.
