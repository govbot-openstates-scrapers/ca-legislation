Under existing law, a person who files an original statement or report after a deadline imposed by the Political Reform Act of 1974 is liable in the amount of $10 per day after the deadline until the statement or report is filed, as specified. Existing law authorizes a filing officer to not impose this liability if the officer determines that the late filing was not willful and that enforcement of the liability will not further the purposes of the act, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the latter provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
