The bill would require the commission to submit the study to the Legislature and the Governor on or before January 1, 2028, or 2 years after implementation commences, whichever is later. The bill would make implementation of its provisions contingent upon an appropriation by the Legislature or upon the State Department of Public Health obtaining sufficient funds from federal, nonprofit, or private sources.\n\n This bill would create the Youth Sports Blue Ribbon Commission Fund in the State Treasury and would authorize moneys in the account to be expended by the department, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the commission. The bill would create the Youth Sports Blue Ribbon Commission Special Fund Subaccount within the fund for the receipt and deposit of the aforementioned federal, nonprofit, or private moneys, and would continuously appropriate moneys in the subaccount to the department for purposes of the commission, thereby making an appropriation.\n\n This bill would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2033."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State government: California Department of Youth Sports."}, {"note": "", "title": "State government: California Department of Youth Sports: study."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
