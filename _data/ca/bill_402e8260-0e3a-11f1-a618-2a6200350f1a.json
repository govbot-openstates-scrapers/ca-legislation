Under existing law, in order to find that the minor should be transferred to a court of criminal jurisdiction, the court is required to find by clear and convincing evidence that the minor is not amenable to rehabilitation while under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\n\nThis bill would instead require that the court find by a preponderance of the evidence that the minor is not amenable to rehabilitation while under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
