{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB2318", "title": "Law enforcement: facilitating medical care.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Lawenforcement", "facilitatingmedicalcare"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law generally provides for the regulation of law enforcement agencies and requires specified law enforcement agencies to maintain policies on, among other things, use of force, hate crimes, and gun violence restraining orders. Existing law requires the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to establish and keep updated a field training officer course relating to competencies of the field training program and police training program that addresses how to interact with persons with certain conditions.\n\nUnder existing law, the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, if a person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interferes or attempts to interfere, by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the Constitution or laws of this state, the Attorney General, or any district attorney or city attorney, is authorized to bring a civil action for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in the name of the people of the State of California, in order to protect the exercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured. Under the act, an individual may also institute and prosecute in their own name and on their own behalf a civil action for damages, as described, for any resulting interference or attempt at interference of the individual's exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States or this state. The act authorizes the court to award the petitioner or plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any damages, injunction, or other equitable relief awarded in these civil actions.\n\nThis bill would require law enforcement, as defined, to ensure that a medical professional is allowed reasonable access to provide emergency care once the scene of an incident is secure. The bill would make it unlawful for law enforcement to deny, delay, obstruct, or fail to facilitate access to a medical evaluation or treatment for an individual in custody or detention, or under law enforcement control, as specified. The bill would require law enforcement, if disclosure would not compromise an ongoing investigation or officer safety, to provide documentation, as specified, identifying the basis for denying or delaying access to medical treatment to specified entities within 72 hours of the incident, as specified. The bill would authorize various punishments against a law enforcement officer who violates those provisions including, among other things, administrative discipline and criminal prosecution. By creating a new crime and by increasing the duties on local law enforcement relating to reporting, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
