The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nUnder existing law, community health worker (CHW) services are a covered Medi-Cal benefit subject to any necessary federal approvals. CHW is defined as a liaison, link, or intermediary between health and social services and the community to facilitate access to services and to improve the access and cultural competence of service delivery. Existing law requires a Medi-Cal managed care plan to engage in outreach and education efforts to enrollees with regard to the CHW services benefit, as specified. Existing law requires the department to inform stakeholders about implementation of the benefit.\n\nThis bill would require the department to annually conduct an analysis of the CHW services benefit, submit the analysis to the Legislature, and publish the analysis on the department's internet website, with the first analysis due July 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill would require the analysis to include, at a minimum, an assessment of the above-described outreach and education efforts conducted by each Medi-Cal managed care plan, an assessment of the CHW benefit utilization and services, a demographic disaggregation of CHWs providing the CHW benefit and the Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving services, and data on Medi-Cal reimbursements for CHW services billed to the department, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
