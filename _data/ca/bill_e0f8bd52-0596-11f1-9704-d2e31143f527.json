The fees imposed and the moneys received by the service authority from the Abandoned Vehicle Trust Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, can only be used for the abatement, removal, and disposal of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles from private or public property. The service authority is authorized to adopt an ordinance establishing procedures for the abatement, removal, and disposal, as a public nuisance, of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle and for the recovery of costs.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding these provisions, would authorize the City of Laguna Woods to use the amount of abandoned vehicle abatement funds received from the fee imposed by the service authority that formerly operated in the County of Orange, and the interest accrued thereon, for purposes of enforcing provisions of this code on public highways.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Laguna Woods."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
