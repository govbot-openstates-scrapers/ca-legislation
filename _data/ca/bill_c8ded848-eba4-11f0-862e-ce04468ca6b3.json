Existing law authorizes persons proposing eligible facilities, including certain electrical transmission lines and electrical transmission projects, to file applications, on or before June 30, 2029, with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) to certify sites and related facilities as environmental leadership development projects, as specified. Existing law makes a site and related facility certified by the Energy Commission as an environmental leadership development project subject to streamlined procedures under CEQA with no further action by the applicant or the Governor. Under existing law, the Energy Commission's certification of sites and related facilities is in lieu of any permit, certificate, or similar document required by any state, local, or regional agency, or federal agency to the extent permitted by federal law, for the use of the sites and related facilities, and supersedes any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulation of any state, local, or regional agency, or federal agency to the extent permitted by federal law, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize the Governor to establish one or more pilot projects to develop, finance, or operate electrical transmission infrastructure that meets specified criteria, including, among other things, that the transmission infrastructure is identified by the Independent System Operator in its transmission planning process as a project subject to competitive bidding and necessary to support clean energy generation to meet the state's clean energy goals. The bill would require the Governor to designate existing state agencies, local public agencies, tribal organizations, or joint powers authorities to implement the pilot projects. The bill would authorize the pilot projects to develop, finance, operate, and maintain electrical transmission lines and all works, facilities, improvements, and property, or portions thereof, necessary or convenient for the conveyance of electricity, as specified. The bill would authorize the Governor to issue guidelines regarding application and certification of pilot projects.\n\nExisting law creates the Wildfire Fund, which is a continuously appropriated fund, to provide funds to participating electrical corporations to satisfy eligible claims arising from covered wildfires, as specified. Existing law authorizes electrical corporations to participate in the Wildfire Fund if they provide initial and annual contributions to the fund, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the owner of a pilot project designated by the Governor pursuant to the above-described provisions to participate in the Wildfire Fund. The bill would authorize a pilot project owner who participates in the Wildfire Fund to seek payment for an eligible claim that results from a covered wildfire, consistent with the relevant requirements applicable to electrical corporations and subject to specific requirements, including, among other things, that the Wildfire Fund Administrator determines the timing and amounts of contributions by the pilot project owner to the Wildfire Fund. The bill would require the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety to review and approve wildfire mitigation plans relating to pilot projects, as provided, and to oversee wildfire safety performance by pilot project owners.\n\nBy expanding the purposes for which the continuously appropriated Wildfire Fund may be used, the bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
