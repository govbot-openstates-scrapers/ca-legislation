Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, in consultation with the California State University and the University of California, to establish a Pay-It-Forward Financial Aid Program that allows students to enroll at a California State University or University of California campus without paying upfront tuition, fees, or room and board, and instead requiring participating students to pay, upon graduation or disenrollment and employment, a percentage of their annual adjusted gross income to the state for a number of years, as determined by the commission. The bill would require those collected payments to be deposited into the Pay-It-Forward Financial Aid Fund, which the bill would establish. The bill would require moneys in the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to pay the tuition, fees, and room and board expenses of future participating students. The bill would require, commencing with the 2028\u201329 academic year, each California State University and University of California campus to offer the program to their students, and would require, commencing with the 2030\u201331 academic year, the California State University and the University of California to ensure that at least 10,000 students per year participate in the program."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Physical education: encouraged activities: prekindergarten."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
