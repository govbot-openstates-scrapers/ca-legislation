If a business knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship, existing law requires the business to register with the CPPA as a data broker, except as specified. Existing law requires the CPPA to establish an accessible deletion mechanism that allows a consumer to request that every data broker delete any personal information related to that consumer held by the data broker or associated service provider or contractor, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require the Secretary of State to provide to the agency a list of all state or local elected officials that, if available, includes each official's personal information, as specified, would require the Judicial Council to provide the agency with a list of all California judges, and would require the agency to allow elected officials or a judges to remove their information from those lists, as prescribed. The bill would require the lists to be kept confidential, as specified. The bill would also require the agency to upload the lists to the accessible deletion mechanism described above and would require an entity receiving a notification that a deletion is required to do so within 5 days.\n\nThis bill would authorize an elected official or judge who is on a list described above, the Attorney General, a county counsel, or a city attorney to bring a civil action for a violation of the bill, as prescribed.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Data brokers: personal information of threatened elected officials, judges, and their immediate family members."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act: personal information of elected and appointed officials."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Public Records Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
