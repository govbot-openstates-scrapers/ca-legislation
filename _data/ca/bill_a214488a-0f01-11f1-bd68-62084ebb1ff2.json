Existing law makes a violation of the act a misdemeanor.\n\nExisting law requires the business of a licensee under the act to be operated under the direction, control, charge, or management of the licensee, if they are qualified, or the person who is qualified to act as the qualified manager, and establishes requirements for a qualified manager, including obtaining a qualification certificate from the bureau. Existing law prohibits a licensee or qualified manager of a licensee from carrying or using a firearm unless the person has met specified requirements and possesses a valid firearms qualification card.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person employed by a licensee from carrying or using a specified BB device unless they have completed prescribed training, as provided. Because the bill would expand the scope of a crime under the Private Security Services Act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
