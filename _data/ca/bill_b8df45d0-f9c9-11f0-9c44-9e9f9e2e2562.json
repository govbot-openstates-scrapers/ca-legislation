Existing law requires the Energy Commission and PUC, in coordination with the Independent System Operator, every 5 years, to review and update, as necessary, the memorandum of understanding and a related workplan to ensure the memorandum and workplan reflect the coordination that is needed to help meet the state's energy goals.\n\nThis bill would require those entities to review and update, as necessary, the memorandum every 3 years, rather than every 5 years."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
