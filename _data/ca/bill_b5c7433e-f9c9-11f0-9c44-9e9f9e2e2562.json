Existing law additionally requires 8 strips of fluorescent yellow reflective tape made of certain high-performance retroreflective sheeting to be placed on specified locations on a trash receptacle or storage container, unless the trash receptacle or storage container's reflective tape is made of the high-performance retroreflective sheeting and was applied before July 1, 2023.\n\nThis bill would apply this exemption from the additional, 8-strip requirement to a receptacle or container with reflectors applied prior to January 1, 2025, and would eliminate the exemption's requirement for the reflectors to be reflective tape made of certain high-performance retroreflective sheeting. The bill would require, when not exempted, the reflective tape for a storage container transported by truck and trailer to be fluorescent yellow, red, white, or alternating red and white, and be made of specified high-performance retroreflective sheeting."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
