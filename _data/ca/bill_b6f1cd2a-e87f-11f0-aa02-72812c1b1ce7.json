Under existing law, a \"class 1 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that, among other things, provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. Under existing law, a \"class 2 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle and is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour. Under existing law, a \"class 3 electric bicycle\" is a bicycle equipped with a speedometer and a motor that, in pertinent part, provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 miles per hour. Existing law prohibits a person under 16 years of age from operating a class 3 electric bicycle. A violation of this provision is punishable as an infraction.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person from selling a class 3 electric bicycle to a person under 16 years of age and would make a violation of that prohibition an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. By creating a new infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Vehicles: bicycle helmets."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
