Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to post, and annually update, on the State Department of Education's internet website, and notify school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools of the availability of, a list of statewide resources that provide support to youth, and their families, who have been subjected to school-based discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying.\n\nThis bill would require the Superintendent, by July 1, 2026, to develop and post on the department's internet website guidance and a list of statewide resources for the purpose of preventing teen dating violence. The bill would also require, by January 1, 2027, each county office of education, school district, and charter school maintaining any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, to post the guidance and list of statewide resources developed by the Superintendent on their respective internet website. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "School safety: Safe Place to Learn Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
