For certain video, print, electronic media, or text message advertisements, existing law permits the name of the committee that paid for the advertisement to be shortened, as specified.\n\nThis bill would establish the Billboard DISCLOSE Act. For purposes of the above provision permitting the name of the committee to be shortened, this bill would clarify that a print advertisement includes a yard sign or a billboard and an electronic media advertisement means a graphic, image, animated graphic, or animated image that the online platform hosting the advertisement allows to link to an internet website paid for by the committee, as specified. For certain advertisements, the bill would permit the names of top contributors to be shortened by using approved abbreviations or leaving out words from the top contributor's name, as specified. For certain advertisements, the bill would also specify the order in which required disclosures must appear on the advertisement.\n\n(2) For larger printed advertisements such as yard signs and billboards, existing law permits the text of the disclosure to be adjusted so that it does not appear on separate horizontal lines, with the names of the top contributors separated by a comma.\n\nThis bill would also permit the names of the top contributors to be separated by clearly visible bullet points or by inserting the applicable number (1, 2, or 3) before the names of the 3 largest contributors. The bill would also specify the order in which required disclosures must appear on the advertisement.\n\n(3) Under existing law, an advertisement supporting or opposing a candidate that is paid for by an independent expenditure must include a statement that it was not authorized by a candidate or a committee controlled by a candidate. If the advertisement was authorized or paid for by a candidate for another office, the expenditure must instead include a statement that \"This advertisement was not authorized or paid for by a candidate for this office or a committee controlled by a candidate for this office.\"\n\nThis bill would shorten the above statements, respectively, to \"Not paid for by candidate\" and \"Not paid for by a candidate for this office.\"\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Political Reform Act of 1974: print advertisements."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
