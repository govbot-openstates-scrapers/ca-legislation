{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB2693", "title": "California State University: doctoral programs.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["CaliforniaStateUniversity", "doctoralprograms"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the California State University (CSU) , under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California (UC) , under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in the state. Existing law provides for the missions and functions of these segments and vests the UC with the sole authority in public higher education to award doctoral degrees in all fields of learning, except that the CSU may award doctoral degrees jointly, with, among others, independent institutions of higher education if the proposed doctoral program is approved by the California Postsecondary Education Commission.\n\nThis bill would authorize the CSU to jointly award doctoral degrees with independent institutions of higher education without the approval of the California Postsecondary Education Commission.\n\n Existing law authorizes the CSU, in consultation with the office of the President of the University of California, to award professional or applied doctoral degrees statewide that do not duplicate UC doctoral degrees and that meet certain requirements. Existing law requires a CSU campus seeking authorization to offer a professional or applied doctoral degree program to submit to the office of the Chancellor of the California State University certain nonduplication documentation, enrollment projections, an administrative plan, and statewide workforce data. Existing law requires the chancellor to notify, in writing, and to send relevant materials on the proposed doctoral program to, the president's office and the President of the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities to allow for consultation on issues of duplication. Existing law prohibits the trustees from approving for implementation a proposed doctoral program if the president's office provided written objections on the basis of duplication within 120 days of notice and receipt of materials for the proposed doctoral program unless and until a letter indicating resolution of the objections and a mutual agreement, signed by the chancellor and the president, is submitted to certain legislative committees. Existing law limits the total number of professional or applied doctoral degree programs offered by a CSU campus to 25% of the total number of undergraduate, graduate through the master's degree, and professional and teacher education programs offered by the CSU campus.\n\nThis bill would authorize the CSU to award doctoral degrees statewide without limiting it to professional or applied doctoral degrees that do not duplicate UC doctoral degrees. The bill would revise the information a CSU campus seeking to offer a doctoral degree program is required to submit for review by the chancellor's office and approval by the trustees. The bill would repeal the requirements related to consulting with the president's office and submitting information to the president's office and the President of the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities to allow for consultation on issues of duplication. The bill would remove the president's office's authority to object to a proposed doctoral program on the basis of duplication. The bill would also repeal the limit on the total number of doctoral degree programs that may be offered by a CSU campus. The bill would also make conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
