Among these requirements, existing law establishes requirements concerning height limits, density, and residential floor area ratio in accordance with a development's proximity to specified tiers of TOD stops, as provided, and requires a development to meet specified labor standards that require that a specified affidavit be signed under penalty of perjury, under specified circumstances. Existing law specifies that a development proposed pursuant to these provisions is eligible for streamlined, ministerial approval, as provided. Existing law defines, among other terms, the term \"high-frequency commuter rail\" for purposes of these provisions to mean a commuter rail service operating a total of at least 48 trains per day across both directions, not including temporary service changes of less than one month or unplanned disruptions, and not meeting the standard for very high frequency commuter rail, at any point in the past three years. Existing law also defines the term \"Tier 2 transit-oriented development stop\" for these purposes to mean a TOD stop within an urban transit county, as defined, excluding a Tier 1 transit-oriented development stop, as defined, served by light rail transit, by high-frequency commuter rail, or by bus service meeting specified standards.\n\nThis bill would revise the definition of \"high-frequency commuter rail\" to instead mean a public commuter or intercity rail station with a total of at least 48 passenger trains on average per weekday across all directions, not including temporary service changes of less than one month or unplanned disruptions, and not meeting the standard for very high frequency commuter rail, at any point in the past three years. By increasing the duties of local officials, and by expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing development: streamlined approvals."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
