Under existing law, intent is evidenced by acting in a manner and under circumstances that openly demonstrate the purpose of inducing, enticing, or soliciting prostitution, or procuring another to commit prostitution, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that a person is guilty of the above-described crime only if they take a direct but ineffectual act that goes beyond planning or preparation towards commission of the crime that indicates a definite and unambiguous intent to purchase commercial sex.
