Pursuant to constitutional authorization, existing property tax law excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" for these purposes the construction or addition of any active solar energy system, as defined, through the 2025\u201326 fiscal year, as provided. Existing law provides the exclusion for an active solar energy system applies to the initial purchaser of a new building, as provided, and requires the initial purchaser to file a claim with the assessor. \n\nThis bill would state a claim filed by an initial purchaser is timely if it is filed within three years of the date of purchase. The bill would also provide that an otherwise valid claim for exclusion filed after the three year deadline would be applied beginning on the lien date for the assessment year in which the claim is filed. The bill would make these provisions operative beginning January 1, 2027.\n\n(2) Existing law, with respect to supplemental property tax assessments, specifies various limitation periods for assessments on the supplemental tax roll. Existing law provides for the application of property tax exemptions to those supplemental assessments provided, among other things, that an assessee file an exemption application within a specified time. Existing property tax law allows taxes, penalties, and interest imposed for late filings of property tax exemption applications for the supplemental roll that exceed $250 in total to be canceled or refunded up to 85% or 90%, as applicable, in the case of the exemption for a college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, or veterans' organization.\n\nThis bill would expand this reduction to be applied to exemptions for public schools, as provided.\n\n(3) Existing property tax law provides, with respect to property eligible for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans' organization, free public libraries, free museums, public schools, community colleges, state colleges, state universities, tribal housing, or welfare exemption but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, that 90% of any tax or penalty or interest on that property shall be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the lien date in the calendar year next succeeding the calendar year in which the exemption was not claimed by a timely application.\n\nExisting property tax law requires, if an appropriate application for exemption is filed within 90 days from the first day of the month following the month in which the property was acquired or by February 15 of the following calendar year, whichever occurs first, any tax or penalty or interest imposed upon property owned by any organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans' organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption that is acquired by that organization during a given calendar year, after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year, if the property is of a kind that would have been qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans' organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, to be canceled or refunded.\n\nThis bill would add public schools to the list of entities eligible for the cancellation or refund of any tax or penalty or interest imposed on property acquired in a given calendar year after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year. The bill also would make conforming changes. By expanding the duties of local tax officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
