The bill would define \"federal funding lapse\" to mean any period during which the federal government fails to appropriate sufficient funds to the United States Department of Agriculture to cover the full monthly allotment of SNAP benefits for eligible households in California, and would require the Director of Social Services to declare a federal funding lapse during any period that meets that definition. The bill would, in the event of a declaration by the director of a federal funding lapse, continuously appropriate to the department from the General Fund an amount necessary to cover the costs to implement these provisions, as determined by the director.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
