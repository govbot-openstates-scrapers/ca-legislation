Existing law establishes certain exceptions and makes any unwarranted disclosure or use of the information by the administering person or receiving agency a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would create a new exception to the above-described prohibition to authorize the Franchise Tax Board to disclose return or return information to the California Cradle-to-Career Data System through information sharing agreements and pursuant to a participation agreement, as specified. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
