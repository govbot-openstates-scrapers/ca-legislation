Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law, except as provided and under certain circumstances, prohibits a person who manufactures a prescription drug from offering a discount, repayment, product voucher, or other reduction in an individual's out-of-pocket expenses associated with their health insurance or health care service plan. Existing law generally imposes specified cost sharing limits on covered prescription drugs.\n\nThis bill would require a health care service plan or health insurer, when calculating an enrollee's or insured's overall contribution to an out-of-pocket maximum or cost sharing requirement under the plan contract or insurance policy, to count any amount paid by the enrollee or insured or on behalf of the enrollee or insured toward the enrollee's or insured's cost sharing, including any form of direct support offered by drug manufacturers that is permitted. The bill would prescribe an administrative penalty for each violation by a health insurer that is enforceable by the Insurance Commissioner after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing. Because a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
