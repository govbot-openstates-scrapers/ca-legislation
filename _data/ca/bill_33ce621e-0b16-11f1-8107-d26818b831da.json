Existing law designates the Surgeon General as the director of the office.\n\nExisting law establishes the California Community Colleges, the California State University, the University of California, independent institutions of higher education, and private postsecondary educational institutions as the segments of postsecondary education in the state.\n\nExisting law provides that each school district governing board shall have general control of, and be responsible for, all aspects of the interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities in its district, including, but not limited to, eligibility, season of sport, number of sports, personnel, and sports facilities.\n\nThis bill, which would be known as Sarah Shulze's Law, would require the Surgeon General, on or before July 1, 2027, to identify and compile a list of age-appropriate mental health training programs that local educational agencies and postsecondary educational institutions can use to train athletic coaches that meet minimum standards, which the Surgeon General would be required to establish. The bill would require the California State University, each community college district, and each private postsecondary educational institution and independent institution of higher education that receives state financial assistance to, and would request the University of California to, require a person hired to an athletic coach position to complete a student mental health training that has been approved by the Surgeon General. By imposing new duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nIf a school district, county office of education, or charter school offers an interscholastic athletic program, the bill would require the governing board or body of the local educational agency to require a person hired to an athletic coach position to complete a pupil mental health training that has been approved by the Surgeon General.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
