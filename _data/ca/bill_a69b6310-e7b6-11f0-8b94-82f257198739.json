The bill would require a majority vote by the appointed members for the council for the approval of funding for any research project or proposal presented for funding. The bill would authorize the council to establish one or more scientific peer review panels consisting of experts in specified fields of research for the purposes of reviewing and prioritizing proposals on the basis of the track record of the investigators, scientific merit of the proposal, and potential benefit to the health and well-being of the population, natural resources, and environment of the state.\n\nThis bill would require all research and development funded by the California Foundation for Science and Health Research Fund to be conducted under established standards of open scientific exchange, peer review, and public oversight.
