Existing law provides a specific procedure for the disposal of an abandoned vehicle valued at $500 or less that includes notifying the Stolen Vehicle System of the Department of Justice and contacting the registered and legal owners of record with the Department of Motor Vehicles, among other procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill, until January 1, 2030, would authorize the Counties of Alameda and Los Angeles to implement similar procedures for the disposal of recreational vehicles, as defined, valued at $4,000 or less. The bill would impose specified conditions on this authority, including requiring a public agency, prior to disposing of a recreational vehicle, to provide authorization that the recreational vehicle is inoperable, except as specified. The bill would make the public agency that removed, or caused the removal of, the recreational vehicle and that directed any towing or storage, responsible for the towing and storage costs if it is determined that the vehicle was not inoperable or was not a hazard to public health, safety, and welfare. The bill would require each local public agency that is authorized and designated to remove vehicles pursuant to these provisions to report certain data to their governing body on an annual basis, including the number of recreational vehicles removed and the number of people found in the recreational vehicle prior to removal.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Counties of Alameda and Los Angeles."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Courts: Judicial Council."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
