Existing law, the Reproductive Privacy Act, prohibits the state from denying or interfering with a pregnant person's right to choose or obtain an abortion prior to viability of the fetus, or when the abortion is necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. \n\nExisting law requires the California Health and Human Services Agency, or an entity designated by the agency, to establish an internet website where the public can find information on abortion services in the state. Existing law requires the internet website to include specified information and resources, including, among other things, the location of abortion providers and practical support services, as specified, to help a person access and obtain an abortion. Existing law requires the internet website to be updated every 6 months. \n\nThis bill would require the State Department of Public Health to partner with an organization, as specified, to update and maintain the above-described internet website. The bill would require the internet website to include additional information on sexual and reproductive health, including, among others, sexual and reproductive health information historically relied on and made available on federal internet websites, as specified. The bill would require the organization to recruit, form, and consult with a stakeholder workgroup and community workgroup, as specified, to determine and update the information and resources posted on the internet website. The bill would require the organization, in consultation with those workgroups, to review the information and resources on the internet website to ensure that it is current and updated at reasonable intervals, but no less than once every 3 months. The bill would require the department to ensure public awareness of the internet website, as specified. The bill would require the department to prepare and submit a report to the Legislature on an annual basis that includes, at a minimum, information about the internet website's reach and impact.
