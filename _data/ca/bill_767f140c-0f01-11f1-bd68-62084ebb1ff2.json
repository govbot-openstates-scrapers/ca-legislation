Existing law requires area agencies on aging and independent living centers to be the core local partners in developing and operating ADRC programs, and sets out their duties.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the California Department of Aging from revoking the designation of an ADRC program solely due to the revocation of a designation, suspension, or temporary inability of either the area agency on aging or the independent living center partner to serve in its operator role, and would authorize the remaining partner to continue to operate the ADRC independently during a transition period, as specified."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
