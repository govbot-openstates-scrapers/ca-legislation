The bill would also require the department to invite local, state, tribal, and federal fire agencies to participate in those familiarization and training activities. The bill would require the department to convene, within 60 days of completion of the pilot project, or January 1, 2029, whichever comes first, leading fire professionals in California to assess the performance of the pilot project and, if the pilot project meets its objectives, determine how to incorporate autonomous aerial suppression technology into existing state wildfire mitigation efforts. The bill would require an operator of autonomous aerial suppression technology that is part of the pilot project and that is required to submit reports to local or federal agencies about autonomous aerial suppression technology to also provide those reports to the department and the Legislature, as provided.
