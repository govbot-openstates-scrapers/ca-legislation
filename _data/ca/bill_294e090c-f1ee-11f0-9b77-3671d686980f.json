Existing law authorizes the establishment of community college districts under the administration of community college governing boards, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at community college campuses throughout the state. Existing law authorizes the governing board of a community college district to terminate the employment of a temporary employee at its discretion at the end of a day or week, whichever is appropriate, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require, if the governing board of a community college district terminates the employment of a temporary employee, that the procedure for terminating the temporary employee comply with the provisions of the local collective bargaining agreement that pertain to the termination of a temporary employee. The bill would provide that, in all cases, part-time faculty assignments are temporary in nature, contingent on enrollment and funding, and subject to program changes, and no part-time faculty member has reasonable assurance of continued employment at any point, irrespective of the status, length of service, or reemployment preference of that part-time, temporary faculty member. By imposing additional duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Community colleges: part-time faculty."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
