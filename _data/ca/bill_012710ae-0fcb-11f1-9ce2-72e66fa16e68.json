The bill would create the California Institute for Scientific Research Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, and require the moneys in the fund to be used by the Government Operations Agency to award grants and make loans to public or private research companies, universities, institutes, and organizations for scientific research and development, in specific areas of research, including, but not limited to, biomedical, behavioral, and climate research. \n\nThis bill would create the California Institute for Scientific Research Council, as specified. The bill would require the council to, among other things, develop the strategic objectives and priorities of the institute and determine the research projects that will be funded by the California Institute for Scientific Research Fund, as specified. The bill would require a majority vote by the appointed members for the council for the approval of funding for any research project or proposal presented for funding. The bill would authorize the council to establish one or more scientific peer review panels consisting of experts in specified fields of research for the purposes of reviewing and prioritizing proposals on the basis of the track record of the investigators, scientific merit of the proposal, and potential benefit to the health and well-being of the population, natural resources, and environment of the state.\n\nThis bill would require all research and development funded by the California Institute for Scientific Research Fund to be conducted under established standards of open scientific exchange, peer review, and public oversight. The bill would require the funds to be awarded on the basis of the research priorities established for the institute by the council and the scientific merit of the proposed research, as determined by an open, competitive, scientific peer review process that ensures objectivity, consistency, and high quality.\n\nExisting law, the California Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2020, requires the California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHSA) or its departments to enter into partnerships to, among other things, address shortages in the market for generic prescription drugs and increase patient access to affordable drugs. The act also requires CHHSA to enter into partnerships resulting in the production, procurement, or distribution of generic prescription drugs, in accordance with specified conditions and procedures. The state has launched the CalRx Initiative, a program that in part serves to implement the act.\n\nThis bill would require CHHSA, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the above-described act, to enter into partnerships or contracts resulting in the development, production, procurement, or distribution of vaccines, by any entity that is authorized to do so under federal or state law, with the intent that these drugs be made widely available to public and private purchasers, providers, suppliers, and pharmacies. Under the bill, this requirement would be implemented through the CalRx Initiative and subject to an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Legislature: Joint Sunset Review Committee."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
