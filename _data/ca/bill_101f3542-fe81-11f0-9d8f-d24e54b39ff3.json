Existing law makes various unfair competition practices unlawful, including any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising.\n\nExisting law regulates how a contract may be extinguished, and prescribes requirements for the formation and cancellation of certain contracts, including dating service contracts, weight loss contracts, and home equity sales contracts.\n\nThis bill would, for contracts entered into or modified on or after August 1, 2026, prohibit a seller that uses a fixed term installment contract, as defined, from charging a fee to a consumer who terminates the fixed term installment contract unless, at the time of entering the initial contract, the initial contract includes a clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the total cost of the early termination fee or the formula used to calculate the early termination fee and the highest possible early termination fee under the contract. The bill would also prohibit a seller that uses a fixed term installment contract from charging an early termination fee or any similar fee in an amount greater than 30% of the total sum for which the consumer is obligated under the contract. The bill would deem certain broadband internet providers to be in compliance with these provisions, as specified. The bill would provide that its provisions do not apply to a fixed term installment contract that is regulated by state or federal law providing greater protections to consumers, as specified, or to a home improvement contract, as defined.\n\nThis bill would make a waiver of its provisions void and unenforceable."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Fixed term installment contracts: cancellation fees."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
