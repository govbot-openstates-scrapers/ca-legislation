Beginning on January 1, 2027, existing law will prohibit the court from ordering a case into mediation unless, among other required conditions, the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000.\n\nThis bill would authorize the presiding judge of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles to issue an order authorizing that court to order any case into mediation, notwithstanding the $75,000 limitation on the amount in controversy described above. The bill would require any case submitted to mediation pursuant to the presiding judge's order to meet all mandatory conditions to qualify for mediation, other than the limitation on the amount in controversy. If the presiding judge issues the order described above, the bill would require the court to transmit a report to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Judiciary on or before January 31, 2028, and annually thereafter, containing specified information about the cases submitted to mediation. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2032."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
