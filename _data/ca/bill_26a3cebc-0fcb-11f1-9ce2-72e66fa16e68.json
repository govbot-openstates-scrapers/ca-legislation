Existing law makes a reimbursement claim for actual costs filed by a local agency or school district subject to the initiation of an audit by the Controller and authorizes the Controller to make a field review of a claim after it has been submitted but before it has been reimbursed. Existing law requires the Controller to notify the claimant in writing within 30 days after issuance of a remittance advice of any adjustment to a claim for reimbursement that results from an audit or review.\n\nThis bill would, instead, require the Controller to notify the claimant in writing within 30 days of any adjustment that results from an audit or review. The bill would also require the Controller to allow a local agency or school district, at the sole discretion of the local agency or school district, to offset any reduced reimbursement, as prescribed, or to remit funds to the Controller."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
