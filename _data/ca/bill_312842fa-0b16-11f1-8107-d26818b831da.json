{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1737", "title": "Postrelease community supervision.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Postreleasecommunitysupervision"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to notify the sheriff or chief of police, or both, and the district attorney where certain parolees were convicted and are scheduled to be released of specified information related to the parolee prior to their release. Existing law requires the department to, upon request, provide to the officials described above specified information available to the department, including photographs and fingerprints, concerning persons on parole who may be residing in that city or county, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the department to notify the county chief probation officer of, or to provide upon request to the officer, as appropriate, the information described above.\n\nExisting law subjects a person to no more than 3 years of postrelease community supervision after release from prison or after the person's term of imprisonment has been deemed to have been served, except as specified. Existing law requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to, among other things, inform each prisoner subject to postrelease community supervision of their responsibility to report to the county probation department. Existing law requires the department, 30 days before release, to notify the county of all information that would otherwise be required for parolees, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to provide the county probation department written and verbal notification of the scheduled release date of the person and the information described above no less than 90 days before the person's release, and if the discharge date is set or reset for 90 or fewer days into the future, would require the department to provide notification within 5 business days, but no later than 30 days before the discharge date of the person. The bill would require the department to notify the county probation department of the county in which a person is being released of the name and contact information of the prerelease care manager, postrelease care manager, and enhanced care manager for the person being released to ensure California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) processes are integrated with local reentry service delivery and court-ordered conditions. The bill would require, if a county probation department identifies, prior to the release of a person, that the person's current county of residence may be different than the county of the person's last legal residence, the department to coordinate with the probation department to determine the person's current county of residence and to develop coordinated plans for the release and transport of the released person to the person's current county of residence. By increasing duties on county probation departments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
