Existing law authorizes the agency to, among other things, make loans to finance affordable housing, including residential structures, housing developments, multifamily rental housing, special needs housing, and other forms of housing, as specified. Existing law establishes the California Dream for All Program, administered by the agency subject to the availability of funds, to provide shared appreciation loans, as defined, to qualified first-time homebuyers. Existing law limits the program to providing assistance to low- and moderate-income homebuyers in the purchase of owner-occupied homes. Existing law establishes the California Dream for All Fund, and continuously appropriates moneys in that fund for the purposes of the program, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would require the agency to expand the California Dream for All Program to provide additional assistance, as specified, to first-generation homebuyers, as defined. The bill would require the agency to prioritize this assistance to first-generation homebuyers purchasing homes built using specified state funding, and to expedite approval of that assistance for a first-generation homebuyer purchasing a home located in a moderate-density area, as provided. By expanding the purposes for which money in the California Dream for All Fund may be used, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would additionally establish the Credit-Enhancement and Guarantee Fund for the purpose of distributing this assistance to specified first-generation homebuyers and would, upon appropriation, require the agency to align the distribution of funds with relevant government-sponsored enterprise pilot programs, as defined, focused on expanding access to credit for first-generation borrowers.\n\nExisting law requires the agency to convene a working group to develop recommendations to assist homeowners in qualifying for loans to construct accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units on their property and to increase access to capital for homeowners interested in building accessory dwelling units.\n\nThis bill would require that working group to explore opportunities for first-generation homebuyers to use funds from the expanded California Dream for All Program as down payment assistance for small-plex or accessory dwelling unit ready properties."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
