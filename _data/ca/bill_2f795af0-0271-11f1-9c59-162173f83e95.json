Existing law requires a regional center consumer to be referred to a provider of habilitation services if they are determined to be in need of habilitation services. Existing law authorizes a regional center to vendor a new work activity or supported employment program after determining the capacity of the program to deliver effective services and assessing the ability of the program to comply with the requirements of CARF the Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission. Existing law requires a regional center to monitor, evaluate, and audit habilitation services providers for program effectiveness using performance criteria that include, among other things, compliance with applicable CARF standards.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement for a work activity program or supported employment program to comply with the requirements of CARF the Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission, and would instead require a regional center to monitor, evaluate, and audit habilitation services providers for program effectiveness using, among other things, services standards contained in regulations adopted by the department. The bill would also make related conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
