Existing law requires the operator of a well to file a written notice of intention to commence drilling with, and prohibits any drilling until approval is given by, the supervisor or district deputy. \n\nExisting law prohibits an operator from injecting a concentrated carbon dioxide fluid produced by a carbon dioxide capture, removal, or sequestration project into a Class II well, as defined, for purposes of enhanced oil recovery, including the facilitation of enhanced oil recovery from another well. \n\nThis bill would provide that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation authorizing California State University, Bakersfield, over a 10-year period, to establish a demonstration zone in existing oil fields for research and development purposes to test advanced carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery techniques in partnership with local industry in order to achieve neutral or net negative emissions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
