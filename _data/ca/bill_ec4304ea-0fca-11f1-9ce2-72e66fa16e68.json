The act authorizes the state board to order consolidation with, or extension of service from, a receiving water system if a public water system or state small water system serving a disadvantaged community consistently fails to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water or if a disadvantaged community is substantially reliant on domestic wells that consistently fail to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water. Existing law makes related findings and declarations.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to those findings and declarations."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
