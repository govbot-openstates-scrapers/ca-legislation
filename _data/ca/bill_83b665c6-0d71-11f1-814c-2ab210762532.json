Existing law authorizes the board of trustees to establish an examining committee, also known as the Committee of Bar Examiners, and requires an applicant for a license to practice law to pass the general bar examination, known as the California bar examination, given by the examining committee. Existing law prohibits the examining committee from altering the bar examination in a manner that requires the substantial modification of the training or preparation required for passage of the examination, except after giving 2 years' notice of that change. \n\nThis bill would require the examining committee, on January 1, 2029, to replace the California bar examination with the Uniform Bar Examination created by the National Conference of Bar Examiners."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
