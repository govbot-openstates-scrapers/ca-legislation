Existing law generally regulates residential property insurance, including homeowners' insurance. Existing law establishes the California FAIR Plan Association, which is a joint reinsurance association where all insurers licensed to write basic property insurance participate to administer a program for the equitable apportionment of basic property insurance for persons who are unable to obtain that coverage through normal channels. Existing law requires the department to post various reports, enforcement notifications, and pleadings to the department's internet website.\n\nThis bill would require the department to update its internet website to make it more user-friendly and accessible. The bill would require the update to include regularly posting data, including, but not limited to, home insurance market data, admitted market data, California FAIR Plan data, nonadmitted market data, profitability data, department performance data, and clear instructions for insurance brokers and agents to find and contact specified surplus line brokers. The bill would also require the information be available in an easily accessible and searchable format, including a downloadable spreadsheet."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
