The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Under existing federal law, in accordance with third-party liability rules, Medicaid is generally the payer of last resort if a beneficiary has another source of health care coverage in addition to Medicaid coverage.\n\nThis bill would require the department, in the case of a Medi-Cal managed care plan enrollee who also has other health care coverage and for whom the Medi-Cal program is a payer of last resort, to ensure that a provider that is not contracted with the plan and that is billing the plan for Medi-Cal allowable costs not paid by the other health care coverage does not face administrative requirements significantly in excess of the administrative requirements for billing those same costs to the Medi-Cal fee-for-service delivery system. Under the bill, in the case of an enrollee who meets those coverage criteria, except as specified, a Medi-Cal fee-for-service provider would not be required to contract as an in-network provider with the Medi-Cal managed care plan in order to bill the plan for Medi-Cal allowable costs for covered health care services.\n\nThe bill would authorize a Medi-Cal managed care plan to require a letter of agreement, or a similar agreement, under specified circumstances, including if a covered service requires prior authorization, or if a service is not covered by the other health care coverage but is a covered service under the plan, as specified.\n\nThe bill would require the department to take the actions that it deems necessary to provide clarification regarding the conditions for billing plans to providers that render services to enrollees who also have other health care coverage. The bill would specify the intent of the Legislature that the department offer educational resources to an enrollee who needs assistance with understanding continuity of care and coordinating Medi-Cal and their other health care coverage when requested by the enrollee.\n\nThe bill would require the department, annually from 2027 through 2030, to update the legislative health committees on the effectiveness of implementing these provisions. The bill would authorize the department to implement these provisions through plan letters or similar instructions. The bill would condition implementation of these provisions on receipt of any necessary federal approvals and the availability of federal financial participation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Outdoor food facilities: pet dogs."}, {"note": "", "title": "California Workgroup on Functional, Hormonal, Integrative, and Metabolic Health."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
