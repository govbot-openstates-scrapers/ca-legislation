{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1448", "title": "Coastal resources: oil and gas development.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Coastalresources", "oilandgasdevelopment"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law prohibits the State Lands Commission or a local trustee, as defined, of granted public trust lands from entering into a new lease or other conveyance authorizing new construction of oil- and gas-related infrastructure upon tidelands and submerged lands within state waters associated with Pacific Outer Continental Shelf leases issued after January 1, 2018. Existing law requires the commission or a local trustee when approving or disapproving a lease renewal, extension, amendment, or modification authorizing new construction of oil- and gas-related infrastructure upon tidelands and submerged lands within state waters associated with Pacific Outer Continental Shelf leases issued after January 1, 2018, to follow a specified process. Existing law provides that these provisions do not prevent specified activities, including, among others, issuance by the commission of leases pursuant to exceptions applicable to the California Coastal Sanctuary. \n\nThis bill would specify that the requirement regarding approval or disapproval of a lease renewal, extension, amendment, or modification also applies to a lease assignment. The bill would additionally require the commission or the local trustee, in considering approval or disapproval, to consider additional factors, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local trustees in the consideration of a lease renewal, extension, amendment, assignment, or modification, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Coastal Act of 1976 requires a person wishing to perform or undertake any development in the coastal zone to obtain a coastal development permit. The act encourages coastal-dependent industrial facilities to locate or expand within existing sites and requires that facilities be permitted reasonable long-term growth, as provided. The act specifies that new or expanded oil and gas development is not to be considered a coastal-dependent industrial facility and is to be permitted only if it is consistent with the act and meets certain requirements, including a requirement that oil produced offshore is to be transported onshore by pipeline using the best achievable technology, as defined, and onshore transport of the oil to processing and refining facilities by pipeline. The act applies the pipeline requirements on new or expanded oil extraction operations, and defines terms for these purposes, including the term \"expanded oil extraction.\" The act authorizes the transport of the oil by other modes of transportation if certain conditions are met.\n\nThis bill would require the onshore transportation of the oil to processing and refining facilities to use the best available technology, as provided. The bill would repeal authorization for the use of alternative modes of transportation. The bill would revise the definition of \"expanded oil extraction\" to include reactivation of a facility idled, inactive, or out of service for more than 5 years, or an increase in oil extraction from the use of hydraulic fracturing, extended reach drilling, acidization, or other unconventional technologies.\n\nThe act authorizes the repair and maintenance of an existing oil and gas facility to be permitted as a coastal-dependent industrial facility if certain requirements are met.\n\nThe bill would require a person to obtain a new coastal development permit for the repair, reactivation, and maintenance of an oil and gas facility, including an oil pipeline, that has been idled, inactive, or out of service for 5 years or more.\n\nBecause the bill would impose additional duties on a local government with a certified local coastal program in processing and reviewing an application for a coastal development permit, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
