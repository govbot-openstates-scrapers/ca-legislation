Existing law prohibits the board from reinstating the certificate of a person under specified circumstances relating to the commission of sexual misconduct or sexual offenses.\n\nThis bill would require automatic revocation of a person's certificate if the certificate was revoked based on a finding by the board that the person committed one of those specified acts or offenses and the certificate was subsequently reinstated by the board on or after January 1, 2020. The bill would prohibit the person from petitioning the board for reinstatement or renewal of the certificate."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "University of California: programs and initiatives: report."}, {"note": "", "title": "Unclaimed property: class action settlements."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
