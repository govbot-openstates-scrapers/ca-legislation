The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nExisting law sets forth various Medi-Cal provisions relating to complex rehabilitation technology (CRT) , which is a form of durable medical equipment, including, but not limited to, complex rehabilitation manual and power wheelchairs. Existing law requires a CRT provider to a Medi-Cal beneficiary to comply with certain standards and accreditation requirements. Existing law conditions implementation of these provisions on receipt of any necessary federal approvals and the availability of federal financial participation.\n\nThis bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
