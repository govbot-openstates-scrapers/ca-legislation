Existing law requires a health care service plan contract issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2021, to provide coverage for medically necessary treatment of mental health and substance use disorders, as defined, under the same terms and conditions applied to other medical conditions.\n\nThis bill would require the plan, as defined, to fully reimburse an enrollee who incurs out-of-pocket costs for behavioral health care services obtained from nonplan providers or facilities or mental health prescription medication obtained from a nonplan pharmacy or nonplan provider on or after May 1, 2022, until the department certifies to the Legislature that the plan has successfully completed implementation of the corrective action work plan resulting from its 2023 settlement agreement with the department. The bill would require an enrollee to submit specified documents for reimbursement and would require the plan to pay the reimbursement within 60 calendar days of an enrollee's submission of documented expenses. If the plan fails to provide this reimbursement, the bill would require it to pay the original amount plus 10% per annum interest to the enrollee, as well as a $5,000 fine per incident. The bill would require the plan to establish specified procedures, and would require the plan to submit a monthly report to the department with specified information. Because a willful violation of the bill's provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the specified plan.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
