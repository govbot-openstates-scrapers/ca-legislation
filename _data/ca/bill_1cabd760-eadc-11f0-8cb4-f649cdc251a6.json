Existing law defines various terms for the purpose of the program. Existing law requires a stewardship plan to include consumer, contractor, and retailer education and outreach efforts to promote source reduction and recycling products, and authorizes the development and updating of education and outreach materials.\n\nThis bill would state that the purpose of the program is also to require paint manufacturers to develop and implement a program to recover, reuse, and recycle postconsumer paint. The bill would define \"paint recovery\" to mean the process of collecting and transporting leftover paint for the purpose of reuse, processing, or recycling to reduce its environmental impact and disposal costs. The bill would require, rather than authorize, the development and updating of education and outreach materials, would require a stewardship plan's education and outreach efforts to also promote the proper use and handling of paint products, and would require those efforts to include investment in the training of California's future workforce by working with California apprenticeship programs for training apprentices and journey-level painters."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Paint product recovery program: paint recovery: definition."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
