Existing law prohibits an insurer from canceling or refusing to renew a policy of residential property insurance for a property located in a ZIP Code within or adjacent to a fire perimeter for one year after the declaration of a state of emergency, if the cancellation or nonrenewal is based solely on the fact that the insured structure is located in an area in which a wildfire has occurred.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Insurance, on or before January 1, 2027, and on or before each January 1 thereafter, to report specified information to the Legislature on the effect the above-described one-year prohibition against cancellation or nonrenewal has had in ZIP Codes subject to the prohibition."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
