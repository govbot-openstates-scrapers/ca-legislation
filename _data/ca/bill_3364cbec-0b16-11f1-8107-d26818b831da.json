The act prohibits a district furnishing light, heat, water, or power from terminating residential service on account of nonpayment of a delinquent account unless the district provides a notice of delinquency and an opportunity to cure, as provided.\n\nThis bill would authorize districts furnishing electrical service to less than 100,000 customers to offer customers the option of electronically receiving the required notice of delinquency, as specified. The bill would also authorize those districts to offer customers a prepay option for electrical service if certain conditions are met. The bill would specify that the notice requirement before termination of residential service of a customer does not apply to customers participating in the prepay option."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
