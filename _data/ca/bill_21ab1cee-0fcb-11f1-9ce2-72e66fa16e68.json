A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would require a manufacturer of infant formula for sale or distribution in this state, among other things, to test its final infant formula product for aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury at least once per month and provide those test results to the department, upon request. The bill also would require a manufacturer to provide information to consumers on its internet website or package label regarding specific information about its infant formula that includes, among other things, certain test results for aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. The bill would specifically prohibit a person from selling in the state or manufacturing, delivering, holding, or offering for sale in the state any infant formula that does not comply with these requirements.\n\nBy expanding the requirements relating to infant formula under the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
