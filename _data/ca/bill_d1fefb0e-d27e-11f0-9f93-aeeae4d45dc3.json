The act authorizes the commission with respect to the local campaign finance or government ethics law to, among other things, provide advice, investigate possible violations, and bring civil actions. If such an agreement is executed, the act further requires the commission to report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2025 with specified information, including legislative recommendations, regarding the performance of the agreement. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2026. The act authorizes the commission to enter into a similar agreement with the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Bernardino.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the commission to conduct audits with respect to the local campaign finance or government ethics law. The bill would delete the requirement for the commission to report to the Legislature and remove the January 1, 2026 repeal date, thereby indefinitely extending the operation of the provisions described above. The bill would repeal the provisions pertaining to the County of San Bernardino.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
