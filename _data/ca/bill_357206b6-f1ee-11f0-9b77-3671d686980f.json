Existing law establishes community college districts throughout the state and authorizes them to operate campuses and provide instruction to students. Existing law authorizes community college districts to admit nonresident students, and requires that nonresident students be charged a nonresident tuition fee unless an exemption applies. Existing law includes among these exemptions a student who attends Lake Tahoe Community College and who has residence in one of several designated communities in Nevada, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally exempt from the nonresident tuition fee a student who attends College of the Siskiyous and who has residence in one of several designated counties in Oregon. The bill would require the governing board of the Siskiyou Joint Community College District to adopt rules and regulations for determining a student's residence classification and for establishing procedures for an appeal and review of the residence classification. By imposing new duties on the Siskiyou Joint Community College District, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would, in any academic year, prohibit more than 200 students from being exempted from payment of the nonresident tuition fee pursuant to this exemption.\n\n(2) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for College of the Siskiyous with respect to students who reside in nearby counties located in Oregon.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
