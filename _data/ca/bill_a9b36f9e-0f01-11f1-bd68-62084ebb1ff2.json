Existing law requires each local publicly owned electric or gas utility that provides the energy for space heating for low-income customers to also provide home weatherization services for those customers if a significant need for those services exists in the utility's service territory, taking into consideration certain factors. Existing law requires each local publicly owned electric or gas utility to develop and implement its low-income weatherization program in consultation with gas and electrical corporations and the Department of Community Services and Development to avoid duplication and to ensure the most efficient use of public and private resources.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to the latter requirement."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
