Existing law requires the Legislative Counsel, in drafting a bill or amendment that includes a reporting requirement as described above, to include a provision repealing the reporting requirement or making the requirement inoperative, as specified, unless directed to do otherwise.\n\nThis bill would require those same procedures for a bill that would require a school district, county office of education, or charter school to complete a plan or report with an undefined end date. The bill would provide that those procedures do not apply to routine reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, reporting requirements for the local control funding formula or the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
