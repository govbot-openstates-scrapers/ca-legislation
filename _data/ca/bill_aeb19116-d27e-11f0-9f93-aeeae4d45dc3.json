{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB149", "title": "Public resources trailer bill.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill", "appropriation"], "subject": ["Publicresourcestrailerbill"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) Existing law, until January 1, 2030, generally prohibits a person from possessing, importing, shipping, or transporting in the state, or from placing, planting, or causing to be placed or planted in any water within the state, dreissenid mussels, and authorizes the Director of Fish and Wildlife or the director's designee to engage in various enforcement activities with regard to dreissenid mussels. Existing law requires any person, or federal, state, or local agency, district, or authority that owns or manages a reservoir, as defined, where recreational, boating, or fishing activities are permitted, except as specified, to develop and implement a program designed to prevent the introduction of nonnative dreissenid mussel species, as provided. Under existing law, except as otherwise provided, any violation of the Fish and Game Code, or of any rule, regulation, or order made or adopted under the code, is a crime.\n\nThis bill would expand the scope of the above-described provisions relating to dreissenid mussels to instead apply to invasive mussels, defined to mean any nonnative detrimental mussel species, as provided. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires a public or private agency that operates a water supply system to cooperate with the Department of Fish and Wildlife to implement measures to avoid infestation by dreissenid mussels and to control or eradicate any infestation that may occur in a water supply system, and, if dreissenid mussels are detected, to prepare and implement a plan, as specified, to control or eradicate dreissenid mussels within the system. Existing law requires any person or entity that manages any aspect of the water in a reservoir, as defined, where recreational, boating, or fishing activities are permitted, to be eligible to receive a grant for the reasonable regulatory costs incident to the implementation of a dreissenid mussel infestation prevention plan.\n\nThis bill would instead apply the above-described provisions to invasive mussels, as defined. The bill would require the department to, on or before December 31, 2026, review all approved plans and require all plans that do not specifically address all invasive mussel species known to be present in bodies of water in the state as of January 1, 2026, to be updated or revised, as provided. The bill would require every invasive mussel species to be addressed in a plan within a specified timeframe. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to either approve the plan or provide written comments and suggestions on plan review deficiencies, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the owner of a vessel, as described, to register the vessel in accordance with prescribed requirements governing the registration and transfer of vessels. Existing law requires vessel registration to be renewed every 2-year period, as specified. Existing law establishes a registration fee and a renewal fee for vessels, and imposes an additional fee, known as the quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention fee, in specified amounts, as determined by the Division of Boating and Waterways in the Department of Parks and Recreation, on a vessel required to pay the registration fee or renewal fee. Existing state regulations require the quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention fee to be payable in specific instances of vessel registration or renewal. Existing law requires that all revenues collected from the quagga and zebra mussel prevention fee be deposited into the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund created in the State Treasury, and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, expended for specified purposes.\n\nThis bill would instead apply the above-described provisions to invasive mussels, as defined, including renaming the quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention fee as the invasive mussel infestation prevention fee. The bill would, for invasive mussel infestation prevention fees due in the 2026 calendar year, and each year thereafter, increase the fee in specified amounts, and would require the amounts to be adjusted for inflation, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes a vessel operator to be issued a citation for operating a recreational vessel in nonmarine waters without a valid state-issued quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention sticker.\n\nThis bill would instead rename the quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention sticker the invasive mussel infestation prevention sticker and would require the department to issue the sticker upon payment of the invasive mussel infestation prevention fee.\n\n(2) Existing law, the Farmer Equity Act of 2017, requires the Department of Food and Agriculture to ensure the inclusion of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, as defined, in the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of food and agriculture laws, regulations, and policies and programs, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department, in consultation with certain entities, to establish the Regional Farmer Equipment and Cooperative Resources Assistance Pilot Program as part of the Farmer Equity Act of 2017 to provide financial and technical assistance to support regional farm equipment sharing and enhance cooperative benefits for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, with preference to be provided under the program in accordance with specified requirements. The bill would specify the entities eligible for financial assistance under the program and would require that applications for financial assistance to develop and expand equipment sharing programs include certain information. The bill would make the operation of the program contingent upon the Legislature making an appropriation for purposes of the program. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2030.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes in the Natural Resources Agency the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL-FIRE) under the control of an executive officer known as the Director of Forestry and Fire Protection. Existing law requires CAL-FIRE, in accordance with a plan approved by the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, to, among other things, provide fire prevention and firefighting implements, organize crews and patrols, and employ people to effect the plan. Existing law requires CAL-FIRE, subject to an appropriation of funds, to begin to employ sufficient permanent firefighting personnel to increase the base period hand crew staffing levels.\n\nThis bill would instead require CAL-FIRE, subject to an appropriation of funds, to begin to employ sufficient permanent firefighting personnel to increase the base period staffing levels, without the limitation to hand crew staffing levels.\n\n(4) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that the lead agency proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nCEQA exempts from its requirements activities or approvals necessary to the bidding for, hosting or staging of, and funding or carrying out of an Olympic Games under the authority of the International Olympic Committee, except for the construction of facilities necessary for the Olympic Games.\n\nThis bill would revise the above-described exemption to exempt from CEQA activities or approvals for the bidding, hosting or staging of, and funding of an Olympic Games or a Paralympic Games under the authority of the International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee. The bill would also exempt from CEQA the construction of temporary facilities, as defined, for the 2028 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. The bill would require public notice of any confirmed changes to the location of competition venues of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as specified.\n\nBecause a lead agency would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for this exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law, the California Coastal Act of 1976, among other things, requires anyone wishing to perform or undertake any development in the coastal zone, except as specified, in addition to obtaining any other permit required by law from any local government or from any state, regional, or local agency, to obtain a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission or a local government, as provided. The act provides that a coastal development permit is not required for specified types of development in specified areas, including, among other things, any proposed development that the executive director of the commission finds to be a temporary event that does not have any significant adverse impact on coastal resources, as provided.\n\nThis bill would specify that all temporary development undertaken under the authority of the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, or the Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games as part of hosting, staging, and carrying out the 2028 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are considered temporary events and are exempt from the requirement to obtain a coastal development permit. The bill would require those temporary developments to avoid and minimize significant impacts to coastal resources to the extent feasible. The bill would specify that the exemption does not apply to development intended to last after December 31, 2028. The bill would be repealed by its own terms on January 1, 2029.\n\nTo the extent this bill would create additional duties for a local government, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(5) The Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024 (act) , approved by the voters as Proposition 4 at the November 5, 2024, statewide general election, authorized the issuance of bonds in the amount of $10,000,000,000 pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law to finance projects for safe drinking water, drought, flood, and water resilience, wildfire and forest resilience, coastal resilience, extreme heat mitigation, biodiversity and nature-based climate solutions, climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient farms, ranches, and working lands, park creation and outdoor access, and clean air programs.\n\nExisting law, the Administrative Procedure Act, sets forth the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.\n\nThis bill would authorize certain regulations needed to effectuate or implement the programs of the act to be adopted as emergency regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, as provided. The bill would require those emergency regulations to be filed with the Office of Administrative Law and would require the emergency regulation to remain in effect until repealed or amended by the adopting state agency.\n\nThe act makes $135,000,000 available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for deposit into the California Ocean Protection Trust Fund for grants to increase resilience from the impacts of climate change, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead make those funds available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the Ocean Protection Council for those purposes.\n\nThe act requires $20,000,000, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be deposited into the Invasive Species Account for purposes of funding invasive species projects and activities recommended by the Invasive Species Council of California, as specified.\n\nThis bill would instead make those funds available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the Department of Food and Agriculture for those purposes.\n\nThe act makes $870,000,000 available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the Wildlife Conservation Board for grant programs to protect and enhance fish and wildlife resources and habitat and achieve the state's biodiversity, public access, and conservation goals, as provided.\n\nThis bill would appropriate the sum of $20,000,000, pursuant to the above provision, from the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Fund to the Wildlife Conservation Board to be granted to the Department of Fish and Wildlife for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year to address invasive mussel infestations, including the golden mussel.\n\n(6) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the 2028 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\n\n(7) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 21080 of the Public Resources Code proposed by AB 1156 to be operative only if this bill and AB 1156 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(8) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\n(9) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Budget Act of 2025."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
