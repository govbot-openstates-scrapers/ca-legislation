Existing law authorizes veterans service organizations, as specified, to contract with the department to pursue claims against the United States. Existing law defines \"veterans service officer\" as an individual employed by a veterans service organization and accredited by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to process and adjudicate claims and other benefits for veterans and their dependents and survivors. Existing law establishes the Veterans Service Office Fund, which, upon appropriation by the Legislature, may be used to expand the support of county veterans service offices.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a person or business from charging a fee to assist a veteran with the filing of a veterans' benefit claim to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs unless they are accredited for that purpose. The bill would make a violation of these provisions punishable by a $2,000 civil fine payable to the Veterans Service Office Fund and to the office of the district attorney that processed the fine, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Veterans' benefits."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
