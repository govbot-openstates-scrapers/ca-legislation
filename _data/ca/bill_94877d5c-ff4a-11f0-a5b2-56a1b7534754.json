The coursework requirements include, among others, the completion of one course in visual or performing arts, foreign language, or career technical education. Existing law eliminates the authorization for career technical education to count toward that graduation requirement on July 1, 2027, or upon the occurrence of a specified event relating to career technical education requirements of the University of California and the California State University, whichever occurs earlier, as specified.\n\nThis bill would indefinitely extend the authorization for career technical education to count toward that graduation requirement. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill also would make conforming changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Pupil instruction: work experience education."}, {"note": "", "title": "Pupil instruction: career technical education."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
