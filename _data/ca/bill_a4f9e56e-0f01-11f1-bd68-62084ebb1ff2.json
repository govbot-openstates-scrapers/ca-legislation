Existing law requires a community college district that has a merit system to appoint a personnel commission to prescribe, amend, and interpret rules regarding the merit system.\n\nExisting law requires the governing board of a community college district, including a district that has adopted a merit system, to fix and prescribe the duties to be performed by all persons in the classified service and other nonacademic positions of the community college district, except those persons employed as part of a personnel commission's staff.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to the requirement that the governing board of a community college district fix and prescribe the duties to be performed by all persons in the classified service and other nonacademic positions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
