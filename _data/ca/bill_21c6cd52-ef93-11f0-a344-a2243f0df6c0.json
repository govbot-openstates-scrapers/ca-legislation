Existing law also requires, on or before January 1, 2026, and biennially thereafter, a covered entity to prepare a climate-related financial risk report disclosing the entity's climate-related financial risk and measures adopted to reduce and adapt to climate-related financial risk.\n\nThis bill would enact the California Contractor Climate Transparency Act, which would require the state board, beginning one year after the effective date of regulations adopted pursuant to the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, as specified, to require a large contractor and a significant contractor, as defined, to report annually specified information, including, for large contractors, an annual disclosure of scope 1 emissions, scope 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions, and climate-related financial risk, as specified, and for significant contractors, an annual disclosure of scope 1 emissions and scope 2 emissions, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "California Procurement Climate Information Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
