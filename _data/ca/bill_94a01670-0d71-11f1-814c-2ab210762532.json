Under the ABC test, a person providing labor or services for remuneration is considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business, and the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. Existing law charges the Labor Commissioner with the enforcement of labor laws, including worker classification \n\nExisting law exempts certain occupations and business relationships from the application of the ABC test described above. Existing law, instead, provides that these exempt relationships are governed by the multifactor test previously adopted in the case of S. G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (1989) 48 Cal.3d 341. These exemptions include professional services provided by graphic designers, fine artists, content contributors, and various others, subject to meeting specified conditions.\n\nThis bill would create an exemption for a merchandiser contracting with a bona fide business or hiring entity to provide stand-alone in-store inventory and product placement labor or services on behalf of retailers and brands in the consumer-packaged goods industry, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Employment: employees and independent contractors."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
