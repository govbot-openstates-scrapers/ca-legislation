Existing law requires the Governor to establish a California oil spill contingency plan that provides for an integrated and effective state procedure to combat the results of major oil spills within the state and that specifies state agencies to implement the plan. Existing law requires the administrator to adopt and implement regulations governing the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans to be prepared and implemented and requires the regulations to provide for the best achievable protection of coastal and marine waters. Existing law requires these regulations to permit the development, application, and use of an oil spill contingency plan for similar vessels, pipelines, terminals, and facilities within a single company or organization, and across companies and organizations. Existing law requires these regulations to ensure, among other things, standards for determining a reasonable worst case oil spill.\n\nThis bill would, commencing January 15, 2027, and at least once every 10 years thereafter, require the administrator to solicit public input regarding the appropriateness of the reasonable worst case spill volumes for facilities and, based on this feedback, review and, as appropriate, revise the criteria and formulas for calculating reasonable worst case spill volumes to reflect the best available information, as provided.\n\nUnder the act, the owner or operator of a facility where a spill could impact waters of the state shall apply for and obtain a certificate of financial responsibility issued by the administrator for the facility or the oil to be handled, stored, or transported by the facility.\n\nThis bill would require the administrator to publicly post a list of all applications for certificates of financial responsibility submitted by facility owners and operators on the internet website of the Office of Spill Prevention and Response. The bill would require the posting to include specified information about applicants, including reasonable worst case spill volume of the facility to be covered by the certificate and the amount of financial responsibility demonstrated. The bill would require the administrator to post this information within 7 business days of receiving an application. The bill would, commencing January 15, 2027, and at least once every 10 years thereafter, require the administrator to solicit public input regarding the appropriateness of the financial responsibility requirements for facilities and, based on this feedback, review and, as appropriate, revise the criteria and formulas for calculating the financial assurances necessary to respond to an oil spill to reflect the best available information, as provided.\n\n(2) The Elder California Pipeline Safety Act of 1981 requires the State Fire Marshal to administer provisions regulating the inspection of intrastate pipelines used for the transportation of hazardous liquid. A violation of the act is a crime.\n\nThis bill would prohibit the restarting of an existing oil pipeline that is 6 inches or larger that has been idle, inactive, or out of service for 5 years or more without passing a spike hydrostatic testing program that meets the requirements established by the State Fire Marshal, as provided. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require these tests to be performed by a qualified testing company, as provided. The bill would require the Office of the State Fire Marshal to promulgate regulations as necessary to implement these provisions.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Oil spill prevention and response."}, {"note": "", "title": "Oil spill prevention: administrator for oil spill response: duties."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
