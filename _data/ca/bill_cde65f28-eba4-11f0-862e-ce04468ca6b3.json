Under existing law, the Legislature finds that state government has an affirmative role in alleviating problems related to the inappropriate use of alcoholic beverages and other drug use and that its major objective is protection of the public health and safety, particularly where problems related to inappropriate alcohol use and other drug use are likely to cause harm to individuals, families, and the community. The agency convened the Behavioral Health Task Force to inform its work on behavioral health issues across the state.\n\nThis bill, the California Overdose Death and Addiction Reduction Act of 2025, would require the California Health and Human Services Agency, on or before January 1, 2028, to direct the task force, or a successor group, to create a set of recommendations to support an implementation plan for reducing alcohol- and drug-related addiction deaths by 50% on or before 5 years from the date the task force provides the recommendations to the agency, but no later than January 1, 2033. The bill would authorize the task force to include additional members as deemed appropriate by the agency, including representatives from specified entities, experts, and providers, among others. The bill would require the agency to adopt the recommendations provided by the task force and require the agency to consider specified information, including quality and performance measures to establish minimum standards for effective delivery of services.\n\nThe bill would require the agency, on or before July 1, 2033, to provide the Governor and the Legislature a report of the findings and recommendations related to the extent that the 2033 goal was met and how effective the recommendations of the task force were, and recommendations for beyond 2033 that will continue to reduce overdose deaths and addiction.\n\nThe bill would also make related findings and declarations."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Toxic substances: household products."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
