The segment comprises 73 community college districts and a total of 116 community colleges throughout the state. Existing law establishes requirements and procedures for the initiation and approval of proposals to reorganize community college districts through the transfer of territory between existing districts.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding certain requirement and procedure provisions described above, would authorize the board of governors to approve the transfer of territory, in whole or in part, from specified community college districts to another district upon its own initiative or upon the filing of a petition by the governing board of a district or the county committee on school district organization for the county where territory would be transferred. The bill would require the board of governors to ensure that a transfer of territory and any necessary agreements between the community college districts comply with and meet the requirements of specified provisions of existing state law, including, among others, that the reorganization of any district or districts does not affect the classification of academic employees already employed by any district affected and that the transfer agreement provides for the allocation of funds, property, and obligations affected by the transfer, as provided."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
