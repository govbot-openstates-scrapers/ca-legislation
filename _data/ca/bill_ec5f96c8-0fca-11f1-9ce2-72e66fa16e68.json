The act requires the state board to prepare and approve a scoping plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to update the scoping plan at least once every 5 years. Existing law requires the state board to present an informational report on topics related to the scoping plan, as directed by the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies, at least once a year at a hearing of the joint committee. Existing law requires that report to include a discussion of the regulatory requirements, initiatives, and other programs that influence the implementation of the scoping plan.\n\nThis bill would also require that report to include a discussion of international agreements on the topic of climate change or clean technology innovation that influence the implementation of the scoping plan."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
