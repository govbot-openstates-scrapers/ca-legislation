The authority is governed by a 14-member board of directors consisting of the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles, 2 public members and one Los Angeles city council member appointed by the mayor, 4 members appointed from the other cities in the county, the 5 members of the board of supervisors, and a nonvoting member appointed by the Governor. If the number of members of the board of supervisors is increased, existing law requires the authority, within 60 days of the increase, to submit a plan to the Legislature for revising the composition of the authority.\n\n At the November 5, 2024, general election, the voters of the County of Los Angeles approved Measure G, which, among other things, amended the charter of the County of Los Angeles to, in 2032, increase the number of members on the board of supervisors from 5 to 9.\n\nThe bill would require the authority, on or before July 1, 2027, to submit a plan to the Legislature for revising the composition of the authority to account for the amendments described above. To the extent the bill imposes new duties on the authority, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
