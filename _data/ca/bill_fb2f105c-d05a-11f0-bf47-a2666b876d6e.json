The act also regulates fees for development projects and fees for specific purposes, including water and sewer connection fees, among others. The act, among other things, requires local agencies to comply with various conditions when imposing fees, extractions, or charges as a condition of approval of a proposed development or development project. The act prohibits a local agency that imposes fees or charges on a residential development for the construction of public improvements or facilities from requiring the payment of those fees or charges until the date of the final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs first, except for utility service fees, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require a local agency to waive fees or charges that are collected by a local agency to fund the construction of public improvements or facilities for residential developments subject to a regulatory agreement with a public entity, as provided, that includes certain income and affordability requirements. The bill would exclude from this requirement those fees or charges, as applicable, for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities or that cover the cost of code enforcement, inspection services, or other fees collected to pay for the cost of enforcement of local ordinances or state law."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
