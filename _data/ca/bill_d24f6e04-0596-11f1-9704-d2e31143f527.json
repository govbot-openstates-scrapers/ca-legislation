Existing law prohibits operating an alcohol or other drug recovery or treatment facility to provide recovery, treatment, or detoxification services within this state without first obtaining a current valid license. If a facility is alleged to be providing those services without a license, existing law requires the department to conduct a site visit to investigate the allegation. Existing law also authorizes the department to conduct announced or unannounced site visits to licensed facilities for the purpose of reviewing them for compliance, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the department to assign a complaint under its jurisdiction regarding an alcohol or other drug recovery or treatment facility to an analyst for investigation within 10 days of receiving the complaint. If the department receives a complaint that does not fall under its jurisdiction, the bill would require the department to notify the complainant, in writing, that it does not investigate that type of complaint. The bill would require the department to complete an investigation into a complaint regarding a facility within 60 days of assigning the complaint unless the department requires additional resources, as specified, to complete the investigation. If the department is not able to complete an investigation within 60 days, the bill would require the department to notify the complainant, in writing, of the reason for the delay."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
