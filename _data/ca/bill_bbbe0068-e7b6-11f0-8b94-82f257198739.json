Existing law also requires the office to develop a methodology, for approval by the board, to set health care costs. Existing law requires the methodology to review historical trends and projects and requires the methodology to allow the board to adjust target costs downward when warranted, among other things.\n\nThis bill would require the cost targets to be adjusted for a provider or fully integrated delivery system, as appropriate, upon a showing that prescription drug costs are projected to grow faster than the rate of any applicable cost targets. The bill would require the methodology to require the board to adjust cost targets for a provider or fully integrated delivery system, as appropriate, to account for increased expenditures related to prescriptions drugs."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Community-based perinatal care."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
