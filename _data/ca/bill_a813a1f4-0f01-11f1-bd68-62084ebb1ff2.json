Under existing law, an insurer is entitled to rely upon all statements, declarations, and representations made by an applicant for insurance relative to the insurable interest that the applicant has in the insured. Existing law prohibits an insurer from incurring any legal liability except as set forth in the policy, by virtue of any untrue statements, declarations, or representations that are relied upon in good faith by the insurer. \n\nThis bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
