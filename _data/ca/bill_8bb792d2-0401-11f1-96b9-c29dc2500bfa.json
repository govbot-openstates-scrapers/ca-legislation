Existing law requires the trustees to control and expend all money appropriated for the support and maintenance of the university.\n\nFormer law, until July 1, 2023, established the Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans, with a Special Consideration for African Americans Who are Descendants of Persons Enslaved in the United States (Task Force) .\n\nFormer law required the Task Force, among other things, to identify, compile, and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation of the institution of slavery that existed within the United States and the colonies, as specified, and to recommend the form of compensation that should be awarded, the instrumentalities through which it should be awarded, and who should be eligible for this compensation. \n\nThis bill would authorize the use of up to $6,000,000, as specified, for the purpose of enabling the California State University to conduct research in furtherance of the recommendations of the Task Force, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would authorize the California State University to partner with other universities or nonprofit institutions in furtherance of the bill. The bill would require, before the start of each fiscal year, the California State University to consult with the California Legislative Black Caucus to propose a list of research components to be addressed through the appropriation, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the California State University to explore options to determine how to confirm an individual's status as a descendant of an enslaved person, as defined. The bill would also require the California State University to establish a process for conducting or verifying genealogical research for the purpose of confirming an individual's status as a descendant of an enslaved person for eligibility for reparative claims on or before the start of the 2029\u201330 academic year and to commence the work of establishing the process on or before the start of the 2026\u201327 academic year. The bill would authorize the funding described above to be used to support student participation in support of this goal. The bill would require the California State University, on or before October 1 of each year and until funding is exhausted, to submit to the Legislature and Governor a report with a status update of pending research projects, and any research projects that have been completed within the prior year.
