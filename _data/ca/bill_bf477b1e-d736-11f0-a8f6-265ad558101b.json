Existing law prescribes a process for the disposition of surplus state property.\n\nThis bill would, notwithstanding those provisions, authorize the Director of General Services to sell, exchange, or lease to the City of Imperial, upon those terms and conditions the director determines are in the best interest of the state, all or any part of the property known as the California Highway Patrol El Centro Area office located at 2331 U.S. Highway 86, Imperial, in the County of Imperial. To the extent the property involves specified bonds, the bill would require the proceeds of the sale or lease to be expended on bond payments, as specified, and other costs, including costs for the review of the sale or lease of the property and bond counsel. The bill would exempt the sale, exchange, or lease of the property from the California Environmental Quality Act.\n\nThe California Constitution requires that the proceeds from the sale of surplus state property be used to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued pursuant to the Economic Recovery Bond Act, until the principal and interest on those bonds are paid in full, the final payment of which was made in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, after which these proceeds are required to be deposited into the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties. Under existing law, moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated for specified purposes, except as provided.\n\nBy depositing the proceeds attributable to the sale or lease of the above-described property into the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties, this bill would make an appropriation.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Imperial."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State surplus property: City of Imperial."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
