Existing law establishes the Broomrape Board within the department to advise the Secretary of Food and Agriculture and make recommendations on all matters relating to broomrape, as specified. Existing law requires the board to recommend specified actions to the secretary, including, among other things, conducting research related to broomrape, surveying, detecting, analyzing, and treating causes of broomrape, and establishing an annual assessment rate or schedule of rates to be paid equally by producers and handlers of tomatoes.\n\nExisting law creates the Broomrape Management Account, a continuously appropriated account, in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund and specifies the funds to be deposited into the account. Existing law provides that a violation of the Food and Agricultural Code is a misdemeanor, unless a different penalty is expressly provided.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of the Broomrape Program by 2 years until July 1, 2030. By extending the secretary's authority to expend moneys in a continuously appropriated account, the bill would make an appropriation. By extending the operation of crimes within the program, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
