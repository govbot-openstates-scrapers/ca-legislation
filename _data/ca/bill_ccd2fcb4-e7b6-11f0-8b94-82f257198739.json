Existing law requires a local educational agency to adopt, on or before December 31, 2019, procedures for preventing acts of bullying, including cyberbullying.\n\nThis bill would require the department, on or before June 30, 2026, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to develop, post on its internet website, and distribute to each local educational agency, as defined, a model policy on how to address certain reported acts of cyberbullying occurring outside of school hours and outside of the campus, as specified. The bill would require the model policy to clarify that local educational agencies are authorized, but not required, to address those acts. The bill would require each local educational agency, on or before July 1, 2027, to adopt a policy, or modify its existing procedures for preventing acts of bullying, on how to address certain reported acts of cyberbullying occurring outside of school hours and outside of the campus, as specified. The bill would authorize the adopted policy to be the model policy developed by the department or a locally adopted policy with input from stakeholders. The bill would require each local educational agency to post a copy of the adopted policy on its internet website and the internet website of each of its schoolsites. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Suspensions and expulsions: off-campus acts: model policy."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
