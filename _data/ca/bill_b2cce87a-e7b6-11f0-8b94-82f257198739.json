Under existing law, the Department of Fish and Wildlife may authorize, by permit, the taking of a western Joshua tree if certain conditions are met, including, among other conditions, that the permittee mitigates all impacts to, and the taking of, the western Joshua tree. Existing law authorizes the department to enter into an agreement with any county or city to delegate to the county or city the ability to authorize the taking of a western Joshua tree associated with developing single-family residences, multifamily residences, accessory structures, and public works projects concurrent with its approval of the project if certain conditions are met. Existing law authorizes any person or public agency receiving a take authorization for a project to pay specified fees in lieu of satisfying the mitigation obligation on several bases, including if the project receives a permit issued by a county or city.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the department to enter into an agreement with any city to delegate to the city the ability to authorize the taking of western Joshua trees associated with developing commercial and industrial projects. The bill would, relative to other project types subject to delegated local mitigation authority, limit the bases for commercial or industrial projects to pay specified fees in lieu of satisfying the mitigation obligation, as provided.\n\n(2) Existing law authorizes the department to issue a permit to authorize either the removal or trimming of a dead western Joshua tree or the trimming of a live western Joshua tree.\n\nThis bill would remove the reference to a dead or live western Joshua tree, thereby authorizing the department to issue a permit to authorize either the removal or trimming of any western Joshua tree.\n\nExisting law authorizes the department to issue a permit for these purposes, without the payment of fees or other mitigation, provided that a dead western Joshua tree or any limbs to be removed meet at least one of a specified list of conditions.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast this provision to instead authorize the department to issue a permit, without the payment of fees or other mitigation, if either the western Joshua tree is located within 100 feet of an existing single-family home and any associated accessory structure or that removal or trimming is necessary for the homeowner to meet defensible space requirements, as provided."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act: reports."}, {"note": "", "title": "Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act: industrial projects and commercial projects."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
