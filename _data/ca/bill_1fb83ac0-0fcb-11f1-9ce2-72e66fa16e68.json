The California Constitution authorizes the Governor to negotiate and conclude compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature. Existing law expressly ratifies a number of tribal-state gaming compacts, and amendments to tribal-state gaming compacts, between the State of California and specified Indian tribes.\n\nThe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project, as defined, that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment, as defined, or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. \n\n Existing law ratifies the tribal-state gaming compact entered into between the State of California and the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, executed on August 4, 2016, and provides that in deference to tribal sovereignty, certain actions are not projects for the purposes of CEQA. \n\nThis bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
