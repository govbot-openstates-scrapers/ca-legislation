Existing law authorizes a landlord to serve a notice of termination of tenancy on a tenant who is in default in the payment of rent. The notice must permit the tenant at least 3 days, excluding weekends and judicial holidays, to pay the amount that is in default and due. If the tenant does not pay the amount stated in the 3-day notice to pay rent or quit after its expiration, the landlord may file a complaint for unlawful detainer against the tenant to obtain possession of the premises.\n\nThis bill would extend the notice period described above, to terminate a tenancy on a tenant who is in default in the payment of rent, to permit the tenant at least 14 days, excluding weekends and judicial holidays, to pay the amount that is in default and due.
