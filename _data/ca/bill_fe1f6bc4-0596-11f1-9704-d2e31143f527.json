The bill would authorize the food delivery platform to use an automated system to address customer service concerns. However, if the automated system is unable to address the customer's concerns, the bill would require the food delivery platform to ensure that the customer is able to promptly connect with the natural person in order to address the concern.\n\nThe bill would further require a food delivery platform to provide a full refund to the customer if an order is not delivered or the wrong order is delivered, unless the food delivery platform determines that the customer was responsible for the nondelivery or finds evidence indicating the refund request may be fraudulent. The bill would require the food delivery platform to refund the amount of the original paid gratuity to the customer but to not take or deduct the original gratuity amount from the delivery driver. The bill would require the food delivery platform, if it is not feasible to refund the paid gratuity in the original method of payment, to provide an alternate refund method for the gratuity.\n\nThe bill would also require the food delivery platform, if a customer receives an order that is only partially fulfilled, to charge the customer only for the portion of the order the customer received and to adjust any taxes, fees, or gratuities directly associated with the undelivered items. The bill would additionally require the food delivery platform to provide a mechanism that allows the customer to adjust a gratuity that was included in the order prior to its delivery and request that the amount of the refund be returned to the original method of payment."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
