The act requires the enforcement agency to annually enter and inspect all employee housing for compliance with the act, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require, for employee housing that houses an H-2A worker, the enforcement agency to conduct the above-described inspection in person, as defined, and to post the results of that inspection on its internet website. The bill would prohibit a person operating employee housing that houses an H-2A worker from receiving a permit to operate employee housing without passing that inspection.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public cemetery districts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
