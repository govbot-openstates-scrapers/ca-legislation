Existing law permits an individual who is eligible to register to vote to complete a registration application during the 14 days immediately preceding an election or on the day of the election, and to vote by conditional ballot or regular ballot, as specified. Existing law provides that otherwise qualified military and overseas voters and voters with disabilities may complete a conditional voter registration and cast a provisional ballot or nonprovisional ballot under those provisions. Existing law also permits a military or overseas voter to register after the closing date of registration if the voter is released from service after the closing date, returns to the voter's county of residence, and is not a registered voter in that county, or if the voter is required to move under official active duty military orders after the closing date.\n\nThis bill would repeal the latter provision as obsolete due to the inclusion of military and overseas voters in the general conditional voter registration process."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Voting."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
