Existing decisional law holds that the slight volitional movement of the vehicle is sufficient for a driving under the influence violation.\n\nThis bill would state that for the purposes of a driving under the influence violation, \"drive\" includes the volitional movement of a vehicle with specified levels of driving automation, as defined. Because this bill would expand the scope of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
