A violation of this requirement is a misdemeanor. \n\nThis bill would make it unlawful for a person to represent in advertising or on the label or container of any sunscreen product, as specified, sold in the state, that the product is \"reef safe,\" \"reef friendly,\" \"ocean safe,\" \"marine safe,\" or any other term implying the product does not harm marine ecosystems unless the product is free of chemical ultraviolet filters, as specified. A violation of the bill would be a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
