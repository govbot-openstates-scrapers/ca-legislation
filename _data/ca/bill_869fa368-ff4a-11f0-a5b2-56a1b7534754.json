Existing law requires RIPA to include various members, including 2 representatives of human or civil rights tax-exempt organizations, 2 representatives of community organizations, and 2 religious clergy members, as specified. Existing law authorizes the Governor, President pro Tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the Assembly to each prescribe up to 2 other members to membership of RIPA.\n\nThis bill would require RIPA to include in its membership the president of the California District Attorneys Association, or their designee.\n\nExisting law requires RIPA to issue a report annually that provides RIPA's analysis of, among other things, the reported stop data described above.
