The act authorizes a county to develop an EMS program by designating a local EMS agency. Existing law also requires the Commission on Emergency Medical Services to review and approve regulations, standards, and guidelines to be developed by the authority. Existing law generally makes a violation of the act a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would require, by January 1, 2027, a public safety agency that provides \"911\" call processing services for emergency medical response to provide prearrival medical instructions to \"911\" callers requiring medical assistance, including, among other things, airway and choking medical instructions for infants, children, and adults and administration of naloxone for narcotics overdoses. The bill would require prearrival medical instructions to be approved by the local EMS agency medical director and implemented consistent with the medical protocols and procedures adopted by the public safety agency. By expanding the scope of a crime, and to the extent that the bill would create new duties for a public safety agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Emergency medical services: dispatch."}, {"note": "", "title": "Emergency medical dispatch."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
