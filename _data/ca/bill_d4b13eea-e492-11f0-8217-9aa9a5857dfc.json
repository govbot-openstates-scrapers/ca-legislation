Existing law, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, prohibits, until January 1, 2030, an owner of residential real property from terminating the tenancy of certain tenants without just cause, either at-fault or no-fault of the tenant. The act exempts certain types of residential real properties from that prohibition, including, among others, housing that has been issued a certificate of occupancy within the previous 15 years.\n\nThis bill would exclude housing built to replace a previous housing unit that was subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, was substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as defined, and was issued a certificate of occupancy before that housing unit was substantially damaged or destroyed, from the above-described exemption from the just cause requirements.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 1529 to be operative only if this bill and AB 1529 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Housing: tenant protections: rent control."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
