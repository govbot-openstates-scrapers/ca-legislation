Under the act, when a person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to themselves or others, or is gravely disabled, the person may, upon probable cause, be taken into custody by specified individuals, including, among others, a peace officer and a designated member of a mobile crisis team, and placed in a facility designated by the county and approved by the State Department of Health Care Services for up to 72 hours for evaluation and treatment. For the purposes of these provisions, existing law defines \"gravely disabled\" as a condition in which a person, as a result of a mental health disorder, a severe substance use disorder, or a co-occurring mental health disorder and a severe substance use disorder, is unable to provide for their basic personal needs for food, clothing, shelter, personal safety, or necessary medical care.\n\nThis bill would include in the definition of \"gravely disabled\" for purposes of the above provisions an individual who is unable to provide for their basic personal needs due to chronic alcoholism, as defined. The bill would further define a \"mental health disorder\" as a condition outlined in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Director of Health Care Services to oversee the Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act. Existing law authorizes specified adult persons to petition a civil court to create a voluntary CARE agreement or a court-ordered CARE plan and implement services, to be provided by county behavioral health agencies, to provide behavioral health care, including stabilization medication, housing, and other enumerated services, to adults who are currently experiencing a qualifying severe mental illness and who meet other specified criteria, including that the person is not clinically stabilized in ongoing voluntary treatment and is either unlikely to survive safely in the community without ongoing supervision and the person's condition is substantially deteriorating or the person is in need of services and supports to prevent a relapse or deterioration that would likely result in grave disability, or serious harm to the person or others.\n\nExisting law authorizes specified individuals to file a petition to commence the CARE process, including, but not limited to, a person with whom the respondent resides or a spouse, parent, sibling, child, grandparent, or an individual who stands in loco parentis to the respondent. Existing law requires the court to issue an order relieving the original petitioner if the petitioner is someone other than the director of a county behavioral health agency or their designee and appoint the director or their designee as the successor petitioner. Existing law requires the original petitioner to have specified rights if they are a parent or family member or the person with which the respondent resides. Existing law also requires certain notice and service requirements to the respondent, respondent's counsel, and the supporter, as well as requires the court to order county behavioral health agencies to work with the respondent, among other specified entities, to enter into CARE agreements, among other things.\n\nThe bill would also include the original petitioner, and in specified circumstances, the original petitioner if the respondent consents, in the specified entities that would receive notice of proceedings and service of documents and reports. The bill would also include the original petitioner in those required to work with county behavioral health agencies to enter into CARE agreements, among other things."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission: certification of facilities: electrical transmission projects."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
