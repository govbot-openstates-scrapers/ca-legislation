Existing law makes the department the primary state agency responsible for review and investigation of geologic hazards, including, but not limited to, the strong motion aspects of earthquake and any geologic hazards that may occur in relation to natural disasters.\n\nThis bill would expand the duties of the department to review and investigate geologic hazards to specifically include geologic hazards that may occur in relation to climate change and make other related changes.\n\n Existing law authorizes the director to fix a price upon and dispose of to the public all publications of the survey and requires that all money received by the survey from sales of publications issued by the survey be deposited at least once each month in the State Treasury to the credit of the General Fund.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions.\n\nExisting law requires the State Geologist to compile maps delineating earthquake fault zones, or identifying seismic hazard zones, as applicable, and to submit those maps, as provided, for board review. Within 90 days of board review, existing law requires the State Geologist to take specified actions with respect to those maps, including providing copies of the maps to state and local entities, as described.\n\nThis bill would instead require the State Geologist to revise the maps and provide copies of the official maps within 90 days after the comment period concludes.\n\nExisting law authorizes a manufacturer or processor, upon request, to report to the State Geologist data on consumption or utilization of mineral materials. Existing law requires those reports to be confidential.\n\nThis bill would instead require these reports to be maintained by the department as confidential if appropriately identified as confidential by the submitting entity.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, when selecting a fuel reduction project, to collaborate with the State Water Resources Control Board and the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law authorizes the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California regional water quality control boards, and the State Water Resources Control Board, if accompanied by Department of Forestry and Fire Protection personnel and after 24-hour advance notification is given to the landowner, to enter and inspect land during normal business hours at any time after commencement of timber harvest plan activities on the land, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally require collaboration and consultation with, and extend that authorization to enter and inspect land to, the survey, under those circumstances.\n\nThis bill would also make clarifying, conforming, and nonsubstantive changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
