These requirements include, among other things, that all units in the student housing development be used exclusively for undergraduate, graduate, or professional students enrolled full time at an institution of higher learning, and the developer, as a condition of receiving a certificate of occupancy, provide evidence to the city, county, or city and county that the developer has entered into an operating agreement or master lease with one or more institutions of higher education, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require a city, county, or city and county to provide an additional density bonus, as specified, if the student housing development meets the above-described requirements for a student housing development, the student housing development provides 24% of the total units to lower income students, and the applicant agrees to include additional rental units affordable to lower income students or moderate-income students, as defined, provided that the resulting student housing development would not restrict more than 50% of the total units to moderate-income or lower income students. By imposing new duties on local governments, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
