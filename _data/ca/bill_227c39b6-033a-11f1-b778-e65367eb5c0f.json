Under existing law, willful or deliberate disregard by a licensed contractor of various state building, labor, and safety laws constitutes a cause for disciplinary action by the board. Existing law provides for related disciplinary proceedings and requires the board to promulgate regulations covering the assessment of civil penalties under those disciplinary provisions, as prescribed. Existing law authorizes a civil penalty not less than $200 and not to exceed $15,000 for certain violations relating to unlicensed persons, as specified. Existing law authorizes a civil penalty not to exceed $8,000 or $30,000 for other violations of the Contractors State License Law, as provided.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2026, would increase the minimum civil penalties for violations related to unlicensed persons to at least $1,500 and would impose minimum civil penalties of at least $500 or $1,500 for other specified violations, as provided. The bill would also authorize the Contractors State License Board to adjust the amounts of these minimum civil penalties for inflation every 5 years, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes the board to set specified fees according to a prescribed schedule. Existing law, notwithstanding this fee schedule, authorizes the board to set fees to maintain the amount of the reserve fund at a level not to exceed approximately 6 months of annual authorized board expenditures.\n\n This bill would increase the above-described limit on the reserve fund to a level not to exceed approximately 12 months of annual authorized board expenditures.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 7099.2 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by SB 291 to be operative only if this bill and SB 291 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
