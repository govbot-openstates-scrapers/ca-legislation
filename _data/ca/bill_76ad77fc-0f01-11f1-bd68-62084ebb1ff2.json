Existing law defines various terms related to bidirectional-capable use. \n\nThis bill would expand various definitions related to bidirectional-capable use to include in their meanings vehicle types beyond battery electric, among other changes.\n\n(2) Existing law requires the Energy Commission, in consultation with the PUC, to develop uptime recordkeeping and reporting standards for electric vehicle chargers and charging stations.\n\nThis bill would require the Energy Commission, on or before December 31, 2027, to conduct and publish on its internet website an assessment of, among other things, the electrical grid energy supply, reliability, and affordability needs associated with the state's transition to 100% renewable and zero-carbon energy sources and the target level of grid-integrated vehicle technology use and grid-integrated charging technology-enabled vehicle use necessary to address those needs, as provided. The bill would require the Energy Commission, on or before December 31, 2028, to adopt and implement standards, in consultation with the state board, the PUC, and other relevant local and state agencies, for grid-integrated vehicle technology and associated grid-integrated charging technology of new vehicles, as provided. The bill would require the Energy Commission, before adopting the standards, to conduct at least 3 public workshops to receive public comments, as specified. The bill would require that these standards establish requirements for on-road vehicles of any weight class sold within the state to incorporate grid-integrated vehicle technology and grid-integrated charging technology to achieve those targets, except as specified, and include specified provisions relating to, among other things, classes and types of grid-integrated vehicle technologies that can satisfy those requirements and alternative compliance mechanisms, as provided."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
