Existing law specifies that the act becomes operative only if General Fund moneys over the multiyear forecasts beginning in the 2024\u201325 fiscal year are available to support ongoing augmentations and actions, and if funding is provided in the annual Budget Act to implement the act.\n\n Under either Cal Grant Program that is operative, existing law establishes eligibility requirements for awards under the program for participating students attending qualifying institutions, including, among others, California residency requirements, as provided.\n\nExisting law establishes the Middle Class Scholarship Program (MCSP) under the administration of the commission. Existing law makes an undergraduate student eligible for a scholarship award under the MCSP if the student is enrolled at the University of California or the California State University, or enrolled in upper division coursework in a community college baccalaureate program, and meets certain eligibility requirements, including, among others, that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements for a Cal Grant.\n\nThis bill would extend Cal Grant and MCSP eligibility to a student who was not a resident of California at the time of high school graduation or its equivalent but meets all other applicable eligibility requirements and is a dependent natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States stationed outside of California on active duty, if the member of the Armed Forces of the United States otherwise maintains California as their state of legal residence. The bill also would make conforming changes.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 70022 of the Education Code proposed by AB 148 and SB 148 to be operative only if this bill and either SB 148 or AB 148 are enacted, and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
