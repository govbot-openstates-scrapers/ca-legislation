Existing law requires a person subject to those provisions who is on parole and who violates the law or the conditions of their parole to be remanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole Hearings for the purpose of future parole consideration. Existing law also sets the parole period for a person released on parole from state prison on or after July 1, 2020, and who was sentenced to life, to no more than 3 years.\n\nThis bill would authorize the court to remand a person sentenced to prison for first- or 2nd-degree murder pursuant to specified provisions and released on parole on or after July 1, 2020, and who the court determines has committed a violation of law or the conditions of their parole, to the custody of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole Hearings for the purpose of future parole consideration, if the court finds that this is in the furtherance of justice. The bill would, if the court does not remand the person to the custody of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, instead subject the person to a period of confinement in the county jail, as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Parole."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
