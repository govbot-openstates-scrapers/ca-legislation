Existing law defines various terms for this purpose, including \"electric vehicle service equipment.\" Existing law authorizes the Energy Commission to periodically update the definitions of those defined terms to ensure that the definitions align with current technologies in bidirectional charging and account for ongoing innovation.\n\nThis bill would require the Energy Commission to establish the Electric Vehicle Service Equipment Standards Advisory Board to develop, and recommend to the Energy Commission, state standards for electric vehicle service equipment to ensure safety and reliability throughout the state."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
