The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms in regulating those emissions. The implementing regulations adopted by the state board provide for the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical corporations pursuant to a market-based compliance mechanism.\n\nExisting law, except as provided, requires revenues received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to be credited directly to the residential customers of the electrical corporation, as specified.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to that requirement."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
