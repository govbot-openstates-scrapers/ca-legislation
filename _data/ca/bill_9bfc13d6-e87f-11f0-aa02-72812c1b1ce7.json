Existing law authorizes the court to limit the amount of the undertaking or to decline to require the plaintiff to furnish an undertaking if the court determines that, based on evidence submitted by the plaintiff, furnishing an undertaking would cause the plaintiff to suffer undue economic hardship.\n\nThis bill would expand the type of civil actions for which motions for undertaking may be filed to include actions that challenge a community-serving project, as defined."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
