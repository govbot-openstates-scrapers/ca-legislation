Existing law authorizes a judge in the superior court in which a misdemeanor is being prosecuted to offer diversion to a defendant, and requires the judge, at the end of the diversion period and if the defendant has complied with the imposed terms and conditions, to dismiss the action against the defendant.\n\nThis bill would require a court that has, upon the above-described diversion, dismissed a misdemeanor case that includes a violation that is required to be assessed points to transmit that information to the DMV, and would require the DMV to assess the applicable points on the driver's record."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
