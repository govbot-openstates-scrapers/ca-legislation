Existing law authorizes the State Bar to establish an examining committee, also known as the Committee of Bar Examiners, with powers that include examining applicants for admission to practice law. Existing law requires an applicant for admission and licensure to practice law to meet specified requirements, including passing a general bar examination given by the examining committee, and authorizes certain experienced attorneys to take an attorneys' examination instead. Existing law requires specified applicants to take a first-year law students' examination administered by the examining committee.\n\nExisting law defines \"artificial intelligence\" as, among other things, a machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can generate outputs, which can influence physical or virtual environments.\n\nThis bill would require the State Bar to disclose the use of artificial intelligence-generated content, as defined, in developing or administering the State Bar examinations described above. The bill would require the State Bar to disclose the use of artificial intelligence-generated content in examination study material it, among other things, publishes or endorses. The bill would apply these disclosure requirements regardless of whether the artificial intelligence-generated content is revised or reviewed by a natural person. The bill would become operative on January 1, 2028."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
