The bill would make this crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years, or in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of up to $6,000. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
