Existing law governs temporary and permanent disability indemnity payments and prohibits a payment made by a written instrument unless it is immediately negotiable and payable in cash, among other things. Existing law, until January 1, 2027, allows an employer to commence a program under which disability indemnity payments are deposited in a prepaid card account for employees.\n\nThis bill would extend the authorization to deposit indemnity payments in a prepaid card account indefinitely."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
