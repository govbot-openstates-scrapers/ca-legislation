{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB663", "title": "Winter Fires of 2025: real property tax: exemptions and reassessment.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["WinterFiresof2025", "exemptionsandreassessment", "realpropertytax"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "(1) The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, \"full cash value\" is defined as the assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975\u201376 tax bill under \"full cash value\" or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing law defines \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" to mean any addition to real property since the last lien date and any alteration of land or of any improvement since the last lien date that constitutes a major rehabilitation thereof or that converts the property to a different use. Existing law, where real property has been damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity, excludes from the definition of \"newly constructed\" and \"new construction\" any timely reconstruction of the real property, or portion thereof, where the property after reconstruction is substantially equivalent to the property prior to damage or destruction. Existing law, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, authorizes the transfer of the base year value of property that is substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as declared by the Governor, to comparable replacement property within the same county that is acquired or newly constructed within 5 years after the disaster, as provided.\n\nExisting law authorizes the owner of property substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as declared by the Governor, to apply the base year value of that property to replacement property reconstructed on the same site of the damaged or destroyed property within 5 years after the disaster if the reconstructed property is comparable to the substantially damaged or destroyed property, determined as provided.\n\nThis bill would extend the 5-year time period described above by 3 years if the property was substantially damaged or destroyed by the 2025 Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, Hurst Fire, Lidia Fire, Sunset Fire, or Woodley Fire, or the 2024 Mountain Fire or Franklin Fire, on or after November 1, 2024, but before February 1, 2025. The bill would make these provisions applicable to the determination of base year values for the 2025\u201326 fiscal year and fiscal years thereafter. By imposing additional duties on local tax officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. \n\n(2) The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to authorize local governments to provide for the assessment or reassessment of taxable property physically damaged or destroyed after the lien date to which the assessment or reassessment relates. Existing property tax law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county, by ordinance, to provide that every assessee of any taxable property, or any person liable for the taxes thereon, whose property was damaged or destroyed without their fault, may apply for reassessment of that property, as provided. Existing property tax law requires, for property to be eligible for reassessment under these provisions, that the damage or destruction be caused by one of 3 specified occurrences, including a major misfortune or calamity in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of disaster if the property was damaged or destroyed by the misfortune or calamity that caused the Governor to proclaim the region to be in a state of disaster. Existing property tax law generally requires that an application for reassessment be filed within the latter of the time specified in the county's ordinance or within 12 months of the misfortune or calamity and be executed under penalty of perjury. \n\nThis bill would also authorize a local government to provide for the assessment or reassessment of taxable property damaged by a major misfortune or calamity in an area or regions subsequently proclaimed to be in a state of emergency, as specified. The bill would authorize the local government by ordinance to provide the assessor the discretion to determine the appropriate date of damage for the purposes of reassessment.\n\nThis bill would, in the case of property damaged or destroyed by the 2025 Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, Hurst Fire, Lidia Fire, Sunset Fire, or Woodley Fire, or the 2024 Mountain Fire or Franklin Fire, extend the period to file for reassessment to the latter of the time specified in the county's ordinance or within 24 months of the fires. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, a disabled veteran's property tax exemption for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran's spouse, including an unmarried surviving spouse, if the veteran, because of an injury incurred in military service, is blind in both eyes, has lost the use of 2 or more limbs, or is totally disabled, as those terms are defined, or if the veteran has, as a result of a service-connected injury or disease, died while on active duty in military service. Existing law, for purposes of this exemption, deems property to be the principal place of residence of a veteran if the veteran is confined to a hospital or other care facility, as provided. \n\nThis bill would additionally deem property to be the principal place of residence of a veteran if a dwelling on the property was completely destroyed in a disaster for which the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency and specified conditions are met. \n\n(4) Existing property tax law, in accordance with the California Constitution, provides for various exemptions for property used exclusively for a specified exempt purpose. \n\nThis bill, in the case of property impacted by the 2025 Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, Hurst Fire, Lidia Fire, Sunset Fire, or Woodley Fire, or the 2024 Mountain Fire or Franklin Fire, would deem property to be eligible for a use-based exemption, as specified, if the property received an exemption for the 2025 calendar year, the property is no longer used for an exempt purpose due to damage from the fires, and certain other conditions are met, including that the property has not changed ownership since the commencement date of the applicable disaster. The bill would make these provisions operative only for lien dates prior to January 1, 2033.\n\n(5) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles and the County of Ventura.\n\n(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n\n(7) Existing law requires the state to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\n\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding those provisions, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\n\n(8) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
