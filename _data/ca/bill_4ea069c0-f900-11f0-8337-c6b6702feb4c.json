The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 grants a consumer various rights with respect to personal information that is collected or sold by a business, as defined, including the right to direct a business that sells or shares personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell or share the consumer's personal information, as specified.\n\nThis bill would generally regulate a developer or a deployer of a high-risk automated decision system, as defined, including by requiring a developer or a deployer to perform an impact assessment on the high-risk automated decision system before making it publicly available or deploying it, as prescribed. The bill would require a state agency to require a developer of a high-risk automated decision system deployed by the state agency to provide to the state agency a copy of the impact assessment and would require the state agency to keep that impact assessment confidential. The bill would also require a developer to provide to the Attorney General or Civil Rights Department, within 30 days of a request from the Attorney General or the Civil Rights Department, a copy of an impact assessment and would require the impact assessment to be kept confidential.\n\nThis bill would authorize the Attorney General or the Civil Rights Department to bring a specified civil action to enforce compliance with the bill, as prescribed, and would authorize the Attorney General or the Civil Rights Department to allow a developer or deployer to cure, within 45 days of receiving a certain notice of a violation, the noticed violation, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a state agency from awarding a contract for a high-risk automated decision system unless the person to whom the contract is awarded has certified that the high-risk automated decision system does not violate, among other civil rights laws, the bill. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Individual rights."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
