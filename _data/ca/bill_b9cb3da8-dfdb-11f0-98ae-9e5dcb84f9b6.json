Existing law provides that, of the 12 members appointed by the Governor, 6 of those members are to be from certain air quality management districts or air pollution control districts, as provided. In addition to the 14 members of the state board, existing law provides that 2 Members of the Legislature serve on the state board as ex officio, nonvoting members of the state board. Existing law provides that members appointed as members from the air districts serve on the state board without compensation. Existing law provides that the elected official members of the state board receive $100 for each day, or a portion of that amount, but not to exceed $1,000 in any month, attending meetings of the state board or its committees, or upon authorization of the state board while on official business of the state board (per diem amount) . Existing law specifies the annual salary of each member of the state board.\n\nThis bill would repeal the prohibition on compensation of the members of the state board from air districts and would specify that those members are to receive the annual salary provided to other members of the state board. The bill would repeal the per diem amount provided to elected official members of the state board."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
