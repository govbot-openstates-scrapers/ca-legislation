Existing law requires the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, and the governing board of every community college district to adopt or provide for the adoption of specific rules and regulations governing student behavior and to adopt procedures by which all students are informed of the rules and regulations, with applicable penalties, as provided. Provisions of the act apply to the University of California only to the extent that the Regents of the University of California, by appropriate resolution, act to make a provision applicable.\n\nExisting federal law requires, as a condition of receiving federal funds or other forms of financial assistance, institutions of higher education to annually distribute to each student and employee standards of conduct that clearly prohibit unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs or alcohol, as provided, and a clear statement that the institution will impose sanctions for violations of the standards of conduct. Existing federal law characterizes the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program as a permissible form of the required sanctions.\n\nThis bill would require the Regents of the University of California and the Trustees of the California State University, in adopting the above-described rules and regulations, to place in the highest priority the health, safety, and well-being of the campus community. The bill would also require those entities, on or before July 1, 2026, to adopt, or provide for the adoption of, rules and regulations that (1) prohibit students receiving medical treatment for the personal use of drugs or alcohol in violation of the rules and regulations governing student behavior from being subject to disciplinary action for that use of drugs or alcohol if they complete an appropriate rehabilitation program, as defined, and (2) require students who receive medical treatment for the personal use of drugs or alcohol in a manner that violates the rules or regulations of the university to be offered the chance to complete an appropriate rehabilitation program, as provided. The bill would establish that this prohibition on disciplinary action, and the requirement that the university offer an appropriate rehabilitation program, only apply to a student once in an academic semester, quarter, or term, as provided."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health care coverage: antiretroviral drugs."}, {"note": "", "title": "Public postsecondary education: student conduct: controlled substances."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
