The act requires the department to deposit those amounts into the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. The fund is continuously appropriated to, among other things, pay refund values and administrative fees to processors that receive empty beverage containers from recyclers. The act authorizes, until January 1, 2028, the department to pay a market development payment to a glass beverage container manufacturer who purchases recycled glass collected within this state for use in manufacturing new beverage containers in this state, as provided. The act requires the department to set the market development payment at an amount not to exceed $50 per ton. The act continuously appropriates $60,000,000 annually from the fund to the department to the make market development payments.\n\nThis bill would authorize the department to set the market development payment at different levels, but would prohibit that payment from exceeding $150 per ton.
