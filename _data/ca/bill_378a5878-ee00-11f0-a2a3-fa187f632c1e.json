Existing law requires the juvenile court of the county where that nonminor dependent then resides to take jurisdiction of the case upon the receipt and filing of the finding of the facts and an order transferring the case.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the residence of a nonminor dependent to be changed to another county where they are living if the nonminor dependent requests the transfer of jurisdiction to the new county and demonstrates an intent to remain in the new county by establishing a significant connection to the new county, as specified. The bill would require a court issuing an order to transfer the case pursuant to this new authority to issue the order within 30 calendar days of the nonminor dependent's request, and deems the new county to have jurisdiction over the nonminor dependent within 10 calendar days of an issuance of an order to transfer."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
