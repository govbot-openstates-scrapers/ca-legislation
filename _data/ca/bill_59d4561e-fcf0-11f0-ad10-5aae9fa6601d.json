Existing law generally designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency with the primary responsibility for the control of vehicular air pollution. Existing law requires the state board to adopt standards, rules, and regulations necessary for the proper execution of the powers and duties granted to, and imposed upon, the state board.\n\nThe California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the state board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt rules and regulations, as provided, to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that the statewide greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to at least 40% below the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, no later than December 31, 2030. Pursuant to its authority, the state board has adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in California, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the state board, beginning no later than January 31, 2026, to reconsider and revise the Low Carbon Fuel Standard to reduce the program's financial burden on drivers in the state, including by taking specified actions."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "State Air Resources Board: Low-Carbon Fuel Standard."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
