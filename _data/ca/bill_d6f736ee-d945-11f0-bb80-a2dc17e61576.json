The bill would require initial goals to be established by January 1, 2025, and those goals to be evaluated at least every 2 years to determine whether updated goals are needed. \n\nThis bill would instead require the council to evaluate the above-described goals at least every year."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
