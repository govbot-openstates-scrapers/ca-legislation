Existing law requires the written record to include a statement indicating either that the seller of the junk is the owner of it, or the name of the person they obtained the junk from, as shown on a signed transfer document. Existing law prohibits a junk dealer or recycler from providing payment for nonferrous materials until the junk dealer or recycler obtains a copy of a valid driver's license of the seller or other specified identification. Existing law requires a junk dealer or recycler to preserve the written record for at least 2 years. Existing law makes a violation of the recordkeeping requirements a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would require junk dealers and recyclers to include additional information in the written record, including the time and amount paid for each sale or purchase of junk made, and the name of the employee handling the transaction. The bill would revise the type of information required to be included in the description of the item or items of junk purchased or sold, as specified. The bill would require the statement referenced above indicating ownership or the name of the person from whom the seller obtained the junk from to be signed.\n\nExisting law prohibits a junk dealer or recycler from possessing certain materials, including a fire hydrant or manhole cover or lid, without written certification from the agency owning or previously owning the material specifying that the agency has either sold the material or is offering the material for sale, salvage, or recycling and that the person is authorized to negotiate the sale of the material. Existing law makes it a crime for any person who is engaged in the salvage, recycling, purchase, or sale of scrap metal to possess specified items, including a fire hydrant or a manhole cover or lid, that were owned or previously owned by specified public entities and that have been stolen or obtained in a manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be stolen or obtained in that manner, or to fail to report possession of those items, as specified. A person who violates those provisions is subject to a criminal fine of not more than $3,000.\n\nThis bill would expand the list of materials and items subject to those provisions to include, among other things, items reasonably recognizable as street lights and related equipment, and would increase the maximum amount of the criminal fine to $5,000.\n\nExisting law makes a person who is a dealer in or collector of junk, metals, or secondhand materials, or their agent, employee, or representative, who buys or receives any wire, cable, copper, lead, solder, mercury, iron, or brass that the person knows or reasonably should know is used by or belongs to specified entities, including a railroad, certain utility companies, or a public entity engaged in furnishing public utility service, without using due diligence to ascertain that the person selling or delivering that material has a legal right to do so, guilty of criminally receiving that property and, in addition to imprisonment, makes that act punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.\n\nThis bill would instead make the act punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000.\n\n By expanding the scope of existing crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Junk dealers and recyclers: nonferrous metals."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
