Existing law prohibits a licensed private patrol operator from allowing an employee to perform the functions of a security guard without confirming that the person holds a current and valid security guard registration. Existing law requires an applicant for a security guard registration to complete a course in the exercise of the power to arrest and the appropriate use of force as a condition for the issuance of the registration, as provided.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
