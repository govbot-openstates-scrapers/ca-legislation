Existing law authorizes the county superintendent of schools to seek clarification regarding the LCAP or update to the LCAP and to submit recommendations for amendments to the school district regarding the LCAP or update to the LCAP. Existing law requires the governing board of the school district to consider the recommendations submitted by the county superintendent of schools, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, for school districts that have been identified for certain technical assistance, instead require the county superintendent of schools to submit recommendations, in writing, for amendments to the LCAP or annual update to the LCAP. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies and officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Local control and accountability plans: equity."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
