The act requires the Judicial Council to develop one or more programs to provide competitive grants to provide legal counsel to low-income persons who require legal services in specific types of civil matters, including, among others, housing-related matters, probate conservatorships, guardianships, and domestic violence and civil harassment restraining orders. Existing law requires the Judicial Council to consider various factors, including, among others, the unmet need for legal services in the geographic area to be served, in selecting and renewing participating programs. Existing law requires program applicants to, among other things, describe how the program would be administered and the means by which the program would serve the particular needs of the community, such as by providing representation to limited-English-speaking clients.\n\nThis bill would require the Judicial Council to collect data on evictions, as specified, make that data publicly available online, and report that data to the Legislature. The bill would also require courts to provide the Judicial Council, every month, with information regarding unlawful detainer cases, as specified, aggregated by ZIP Code. The bill would require the Judicial Council to make that information available through a spreadsheet that may be requested through a California Public Records Act request."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
