The act generally requires manufacturers, packers, and holders of processed foods to register with the department. A violation of the act is a crime.\n\nThis bill would add kratom products and products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH products) , as defined, to the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. The bill would prescribe specified quantities of alkaloids present in kratom products and 7-OH products and would establish labeling and packaging requirements for those products. The bill would prohibit the sale of kratom products and 7-OH products to those under 21 years of age. The bill would require the packaging of kratom products and 7-OH products to be child resistant and would prohibit the sale and manufacture of a kratom product or 7-OH product that is attractive to children. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Public health: 7-Hydroxymitragynine."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
