Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law sets forth specified prior authorization and step therapy limitations for health care service plans and health insurers.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a health care service plan contract or health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027, from imposing prior authorization, step therapy, or other utilization review for a drug prescribed for the treatment of a rare disease, as specified, unless a biosimilar, interchangeable biologic, or generic version of the drug is available. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
