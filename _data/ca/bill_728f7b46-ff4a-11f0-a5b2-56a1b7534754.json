Under existing law, if no provision is made in statute for the service of summons, a court may direct a summons to be served in a manner that is reasonably calculated to give actual notice to the party to be served.\n\nThis bill would also authorize a court to direct a summons to be served in a manner that is reasonably calculated to give actual notice to the party to be served if a plaintiff, exercising reasonable diligence, has been unable to serve the summons using methods prescribed by statute. The bill would authorize a court, upon motion, to direct service of the summons by electronic means, if such service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The bill would require a plaintiff seeking to establish reasonable diligence under this section to set forth facts that detail, as specified, the attempts to effect service pursuant to the methods prescribed by statute.
