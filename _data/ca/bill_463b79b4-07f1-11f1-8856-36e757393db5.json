Existing law also encourages those entities to provide to pupils general information on the use and importance of an automated external defibrillators (AED) . Existing law further requires the State Department of Education to provide guidance on how to implement these provisions, including, but not limited to, who may provide instruction.\n\nThis bill would instead require, commencing with the 2027\u201328 school year, the governing board of a school district or the governing body of a charter school that maintains any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, to provide instruction in performing compression-only CPR and how to use an AED as part of a course required for graduation. The bill would also require the department to provide guidance on how to implement these provisions before the commencement of the 2027\u201328 school year.\n\nBy imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
