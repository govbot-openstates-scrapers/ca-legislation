The act authorizes a school district to provide that education earlier than grade 7 with age-appropriate and medically accurate information. The act authorizes a school district to provide sexual health education and HIV prevention to be taught by an outside consultant, and to hold an assembly to deliver that education by guest speakers. Under the act, if a school district exercises that authorization, the school district is required to provide notice of the date of instruction, name of the organization or affiliation of each guest speaker, and information stating the right of the parent or guardian to request a copy of various laws, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require a school district, if it elects to provide sexual health education or HIV prevention education to be taught by outside consultants, to also provide notice of the name of the organization or affiliation of the outside consultants."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Comprehensive sexual health education and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention education."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
