Under existing law, the method allows the contract for construction services to be entered into at the same time as the contract for preconstruction services or at a later time. Existing law authorizes the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to utilize the CM/GC method for regional recycled water projects or other water infrastructure projects under specified conditions. Pursuant to existing law, certain information required to be submitted as part of the CM/GC method is required to be verified under oath. Existing law makes the provisions described above pertaining to the CM/GC method effective only until January 1, 2028, and inoperative as of that date.\n\nThis bill would, until January 1, 2031, authorize a local agency, as defined, upon approval of its governing body, to similarly use the CM/GC method for a regional recycled water project or other water infrastructure project undertaken by the district to alleviate water supply shortages attributable to drought or climate change. The bill would require that authorization to apply to no more than 15 capital outlay projects for each local agency and would require a local agency to award a contract pursuant to the bill on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder. Because the bill would expand the crime of perjury, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Local government."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
