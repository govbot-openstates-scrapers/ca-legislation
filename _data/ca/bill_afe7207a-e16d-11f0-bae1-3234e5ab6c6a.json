The act also prohibits an officer of an agency from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use the officer's official position to influence the decision in a proceeding involving a license, permit, or other entitlement for use pending before the agency if the officer has willfully or knowingly received a contribution of more than $500 within the preceding 12 months from a party or a party's agent, or from any participant or a participant's agent, if the officer knows or has reason to know that the participant has a financial interest in the decision, as defined. \n\nThis bill would increase the contribution thresholds described above from $500 to $1500. The bill would require the commission to adjust these contribution thresholds to reflect any increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index beginning January, 2027, and in January of each odd-numbered year thereafter, as specified.\n\nThe Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act's purposes upon a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature and compliance with specified procedural requirements.\n\nThis bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
