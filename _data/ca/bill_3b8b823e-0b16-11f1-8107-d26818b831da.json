Existing law requires, in order to receive that relief, that the petitioner establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the arrest or conviction was the direct result of being a victim of intimate partner violence or sexual violence that demonstrates the petitioner lacked the requisite intent. Existing law authorizes the court to vacate the conviction if it makes specified findings.\n\nThis bill would require the court, before it may vacate the conviction, to make findings regarding the impact on the public health, safety, and welfare, if the petitioner holds a license, as defined, and the offense is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a licensee. The bill would require a petitioner who holds a license to serve the petition and supporting documentation on the applicable licensing entity and would give the licensing entity 45 days to respond to the petition for relief."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
