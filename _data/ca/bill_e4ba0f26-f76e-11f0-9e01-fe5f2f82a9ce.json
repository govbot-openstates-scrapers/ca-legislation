Under existing law, a person is eligible for automatic conviction record relief if the person meets certain requirements, including that it does not appear, based upon information available in the Department of Justice's record, that the person is currently serving a sentence of an offense and there is no indication of pending criminal charges.\n\nThis bill would require, in determining whether there is a pending criminal charge based on the department's records, the department to conclude that there is no indication of pending criminal charges if at least 3 years have elapsed with no new activity related to that record.\n\nExisting law, subject to an appropriation, on a monthly basis, requires the department to electronically submit a notice to the superior court having jurisdiction over the criminal case and inform the court of all cases for which a complaint was filed and for which relief was granted pursuant to the provisions above. Existing law, for any certain record retained by the court, prohibits the court from disclosing information concerning a conviction granted relief pursuant to specified provisions, including the above provisions, to any person or entity, in any format, except to the person whose conviction was granted relief or a criminal justice agency.\n\nThis bill would require local summary criminal history information provided by the court to any recipient to include notes for any entries for which relief has been granted indicating that relief has been granted pursuant to the above provisions and listing the date the court received notice from the department. The bill would require this note to be included in all local criminal databases maintained by the court.\n\nThis bill would also require a court, upon the request of the subject of a record granted relief, to furnish a certificate of disposition confirming the court's receipt of notification and compliance with a grant of relief for a specified record granted relief under the above provisions.\n\nBy placing additional duties on court staff, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
