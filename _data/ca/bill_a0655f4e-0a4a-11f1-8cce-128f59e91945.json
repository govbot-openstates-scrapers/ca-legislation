{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "SB911", "title": "Transfer of real property: fire hazard severity zones: compliance documentation.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Transferofrealproperty", "compliancedocumentation", "firehazardseverityzones"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law requires a seller of a real property that is located in a high or very high fire hazard severity zone to provide to the buyer documentation stating that the property is in compliance with specified fire safety requirements or local vegetation management ordinances. If the seller of a real property as described above has not obtained that documentation of compliance, existing law requires the seller and the buyer to enter into a written agreement pursuant to which the buyer agrees to obtain documentation of compliance with those specified fire safety requirements or local vegetation management ordinances. In a local jurisdiction that has not enacted an ordinance requiring an owner or buyer to obtain documentation of compliance, and if a state or local agency, or other government entity, or other qualified nonprofit entity, provides an inspection with documentation for the jurisdiction in which the property is located, existing law requires the buyer to obtain documentation of compliance within one year of the date of the close of escrow.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the seller to notify the county assessor of the written agreement and to provide a copy of that agreement to the county assessor. The bill would require the county assessor to notify the local fire department having jurisdiction over the property of the buyer's obligation to obtain documentation of compliance. The bill would also require that fire department to conduct a compliance check at the property if it has not received documentation of compliance from a qualified entity or otherwise certified compliance within one year of the date of the close of escrow. By increasing the duties of local entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
