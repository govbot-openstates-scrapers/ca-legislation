Existing law requires the implementing regulations to ensure that the program complies with certain requirements.\n\nThis bill would require the implementing regulations for the Clean Cars 4 All Program to additionally ensure that, among other things, incentives provided under the program are available in all areas of the state and that, in those areas where a local air district has not elected to participate in the program to manage the distribution of incentives within its jurisdiction, the state board manages the distribution of incentives to eligible residents of those areas, as specified. The bill would make certain conforming changes in that regard. The bill would require, as one of the program goals for replacement of passenger vehicles and trucks, the state board to prioritize vehicle retirement in areas of the state that meet specified criteria. The bill would also require the state board to update the guidelines for the program no later than July 1, 2027, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the state board to annually post on its internet website a performance analysis of the replacement and mobility options component of the Clean Cars 4 All Program that includes an evaluation of the funding for targeted outreach in low-income or disadvantaged communities, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require that analysis to additionally include an evaluation of the funding for targeted outreach in low-income or disadvantaged communities with the highest number of vehicles manufactured before 2004 or that are at least 20 years old, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the state board to consider certain metrics in allocating funding under the program to local air districts participating in the program, and to the statewide program, including the number of vouchers deployed and the population in eligible program ZIP Codes.\n\nThis bill would require the state board, in allocating funding to local air districts participating in the program and to the portion of the program managed by the state board, to consider additional metrics, including the total value of vouchers deployed and a specified metric for retired vehicles, and would delete the requirement to consider the population in eligible ZIP Codes.\n\nThe bill would also require the state board, in coordination with local air districts and specified organizations, to establish a means-based strategy to identify potential recipients of incentives under the Clean Cars 4 All Program that meet certain criteria and, as part of that strategy, require an increased incentive to be provided under the program to those individuals."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Employee Housing Act."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
