The act declares the policy of the state to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, but no later than 2045, and to achieve and maintain net negative greenhouse gas emissions thereafter. The act requires the state board to prepare and approve a scoping plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to update the scoping plan at least once every 5 years.\n\nThe act also requires the Natural Resources Agency, in collaboration with specified entities, including the state board, to determine an ambitious range of targets for natural carbon sequestration, and for nature-based climate solutions, that reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 2030, 2038, and 2045 to support state goals to achieve carbon neutrality and foster climate adaptation and resilience. The act requires these targets to be integrated into the above-described scoping plan and other state policies.\n\nThis bill would specify that it is the goal of the state to achieve each of the targets established by the Natural Resources Agency by the applicable date for the target, with priority given to activities that most rapidly, significantly, and cost effectively increase carbon stocks and net sequestration, protect and support ecosystem function, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The bill would also revise the definition of \"natural carbon sequestration\" for purposes of the above-described provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
