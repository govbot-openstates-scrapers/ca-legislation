Existing law establishes the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority to carry out that purpose. \n\nThis bill would authorize the authority, for that specified purpose, and with its own moneys or from moneys derived from other sources, to create its own financial assistance programs, financial assistance products, or both, on those terms and conditions the authority deems prudent. The bill would create the Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Expansion Fund in the State Treasury and would continuously appropriate all moneys in the fund to the authority for expenditure, as provided, and to defray the administrative costs of the authority. The bill would require any interest earned or other increment derived from investments made from moneys in the fund to be deposited into the fund."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
