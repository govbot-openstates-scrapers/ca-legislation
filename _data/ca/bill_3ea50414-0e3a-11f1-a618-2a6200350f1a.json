Upon concurrence by the Department of the California Highway Patrol that the precedent conditions have been met, existing law requires the patrol to issue the alert, which may take the form of a be-on-the-lookout alert, an Emergency Digital Information Service message, or an electronic flyer, within a specified geographical area.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation creating a PINK Alert to notify all law enforcement, emergency services, homeless shelters, and nonprofits that there is a pregnant person in need of shelter or prenatal services."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
