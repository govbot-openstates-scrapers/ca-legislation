Existing law sets forth the membership composition for boards of retirement and boards of investment, as specified. Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors for counties for which these provisions apply to provide that certain members of these boards shall receive compensation at a rate of not more than $100 for a meeting or for a meeting of a committee authorized by the entire board. \n\nThis bill would authorize the above-described compensation rate to be increased by the board of retirement to not more than $320 per meeting, and would provide that this provision would not be operative in any county until it is adopted by a majority vote of the board of supervisors."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
