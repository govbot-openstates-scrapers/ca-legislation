Existing law requires each agency, within 10 days of a request for a copy of records, to determine whether the request seeks copies of disclosable public records in possession of the agency and to promptly notify the person of the determination and the reasons therefor. Existing law authorizes that time limit to be extended by no more than 14 days under unusual circumstances, and defines \"unusual circumstances\" to include, among other things, the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine records during a state of emergency when the state of emergency currently affects the agency's ability to timely respond to requests due to staffing shortages or closure of facilities, as provided.\n\nThis bill would revise the definition of unusual circumstances as it applies to a state of emergency to require the state of emergency, in addition to currently affecting the agency's ability to timely respond to requests as described above, to also require the state of emergency to directly affect the agency's ability to timely respond to requests as described above. By restricting the time period in which a local agency may respond to requests, thus increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would also expand the definition of unusual circumstances to include the inability of the agency, because of a cyberattack, to access its electronic servers or systems in order to search for and obtain a record that the agency believes is responsive to a request and is maintained on the servers or systems in an electronic format. Under the bill, the extension would apply only until the agency regains its ability to access its electronic servers or systems and search for and obtain electronic records that may be responsive to a request.\n\nThe California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
