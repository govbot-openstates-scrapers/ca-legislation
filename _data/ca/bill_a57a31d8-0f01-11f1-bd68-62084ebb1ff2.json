Existing law defines theft of a value exceeding that amount as grand theft, and defines theft of a firearm as grand theft regardless of the value of the property taken. Existing law authorizes the Legislature to amend the provisions of the act by a 23 vote of each house of the Legislature if it is consistent with, and furthers the purpose of, the act.\n\nThis bill would make theft of property taken without lawful authority by a public officer under color of authority grand theft regardless of the value of the property taken. By increasing the punishment of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
