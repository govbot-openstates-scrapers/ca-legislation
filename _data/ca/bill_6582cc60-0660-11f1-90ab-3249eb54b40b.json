Notwithstanding that requirement, after the initial election, any subsequent election of governing board members in any school district, community college district, or county board of education may be established, upon the adoption of an appropriate resolution by the governing board or the county board of education, to regularly occur on the same day as the statewide direct primary election, the statewide general election, or the general municipal election, as specified.\n\nThis bill, notwithstanding any other law, and commencing January 1, 2026, would require any election for the elected members of a county board of education to instead be consolidated with the statewide general election. The bill would require the term of office of all incumbent elected members of a county board of education to be extended accordingly, and would require the county committee on school district organization to determine the manner in which the county board of education elected shall effect a staggering of terms, if necessary. By imposing additional duties on local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill also would make conforming changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Secondary education."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
