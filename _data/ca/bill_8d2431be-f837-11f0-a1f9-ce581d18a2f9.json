Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, on or before January 1, 2028, to require each electrical corporation to offer optional dynamic pricing tariffs, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the commission to require each electrical corporation, and the governing board of each local publicly owned electric utility, on or before January 1, 2028, to analyze the feasibility of deploying advanced metering infrastructure to all customers. Based on that analysis, the bill would require each electrical corporation and the governing board of each local publicly owned electric utility, on or before January 1, 2029, to develop a plan for complete advanced metering infrastructure deployment, where feasible.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause certain provisions of this bill would be part of the act and a violation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nAdditionally, by imposing new duties on local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Theft of a gift card."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
