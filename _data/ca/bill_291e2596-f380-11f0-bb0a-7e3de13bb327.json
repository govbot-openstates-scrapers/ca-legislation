Case law establishes exceptions to this right, including allowing a peace officer to conduct a limited search of a person for firearms or weapons if the peace officer reasonably concludes that the person detained may be armed and presently dangerous to the peace officer or others, or if the person consents to a search.\n\nThis bill would authorize a peace officer to request consent to search an individual, their property, or their effects only if the officer is investigating a crime and has reasonable suspicion that the individual to be searched has an item in their possession that is evidence of criminal activity. The bill would require the officer to follow a specified procedure in a specified order, including advising the individual that their consent is voluntary, explaining to the individual the scope of the search, and recording the individual's consent. The bill would prohibit an officer from exceeding the scope of the search explained to the individual and would require the officer to discontinue the search if the individual withdraws their consent. The bill would authorize searches based on unsolicited consent if the officer follows specified procedures. The bill would require an officer to record the required actions they performed before and during a consensual search consistent with the policies of their employing agency.\n\nBecause the bill would impose requirements on local law enforcement, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
