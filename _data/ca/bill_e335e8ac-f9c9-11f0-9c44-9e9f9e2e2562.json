Existing law designates the department as the single state agency responsible for the promotion, development, and provision of care of children in the absence of their parents during the workday. Existing law defines \"workday\" for purposes of the act to mean the time that a parent requires temporary care for a child for specified reasons, including to undertake training in preparation for a job or to undertake or retain a job.\n\nThis bill would revise \"workday\" to additionally include the time that a parent requires temporary care for a child to search for a job, provide care for oneself during a pregnancy-related leave from work, or provide care for a family member during a period of paid family leave. The bill would also additionally define \"parental incapacity\" to mean the temporary or permanent inability of a child's parent or parents to provide care and supervision of the child for any part of the day, including due to specified conditions.\n\nExisting law requires that parents meet at least one specified requirement in specified areas, including that they are a current aid recipient, income eligible, and the family needs the childcare services because the parents are engaged in vocational training or incapacitated or are employed or seeking employment.\n\nThe bill would additionally include that a family may be eligible for services if a parent is employed or seeking employment, including while on family and medical leave from employment. The bill would additionally require that, at the time of certification or recertification, if a parent is on family and medical leave from employment, the parent provide a self-attestation form, signed under penalty of perjury, that they are on leave. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. \n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Childcare services: rates."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
