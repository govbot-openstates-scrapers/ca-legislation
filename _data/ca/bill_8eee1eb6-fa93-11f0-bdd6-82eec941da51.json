Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to post on its internet website information on air quality conditions and trends statewide and to develop and conduct a program of monitoring airborne fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 2.5) .\n\nThis bill would require the state board to annually produce an assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transportation of oil in California, as specified, and to include that assessment on the state board's internet website. The bill would also require the Energy Commission to annually provide data collected pursuant to the Petroleum Industry Information Reporting Act of 1980 to the state board for the purposes of the assessment. The bill would require the data to comply with specified existing confidentiality requirements. The bill would prohibit the commission from using any funds from electric ratepayers to implement these requirements, as provided. The bill would also require the state board to post on its internet website a report on the air quality impact of potentially importing 5% to 10% of the state's gasoline supply using tanker ships."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
