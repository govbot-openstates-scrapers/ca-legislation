Existing law establishes the grounds for removal of a dependent child from the custody of the child's parents or guardian, which include that their parent or guardian has been incarcerated or institutionalized and cannot arrange for the care of the minor. Existing law requires, if the parent or guardian is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court to order reasonable services, which may include visitation services, if appropriate, unless the court determines those services would be detrimental to the child.\n\nThis bill would require any order placing a child in foster care, and ordering reunification services, to include specified provisions if the parent of the dependent child is incarcerated in a county jail, including, among others, that the incarcerated parent is entitled to in-person visitation, that the county jail is required to ensure that the incarcerated parent is made available to attend in-person visits with their dependent child, and that the child welfare agency and county jail are required to make a reasonable effort to document specified information relating to visitation and to include in all reports submitted to the court for each status review hearing a brief summary of visitation activity. The bill would authorize the use of videoconferencing technology or telephonic communication in lieu of in-person visits, as specified. By imposing new duties on child welfare agencies and county jails, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
