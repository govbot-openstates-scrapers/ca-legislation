By imposing new duties on local officials with respect to elections, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law provides procedures for the recall of enumerated elective officers, including, among others, trial court judges.\n\nThis bill would replace references to trial courts in these provisions with references to superior courts.\n\n(3) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 15621 of the Elections Code proposed by Assembly Bill 930 to be operative only if this bill and Assembly Bill 930 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Recall elections: superior courts."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
