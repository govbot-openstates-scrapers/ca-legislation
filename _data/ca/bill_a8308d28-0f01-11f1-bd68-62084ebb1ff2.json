Existing law requires the State Department of Education, with the approval of the State Board of Education, to establish procedures for conducting the assessment and for the reclassification of a pupil from English learner to English proficient.\n\nExisting law requires the summative assessment to be conducted annually during a 4-month period after January 1 determined by the Superintendent with the approval of the state board and the assessment for initial identification to be conducted upon the initial enrollment of a pupil, as provided. Existing law requires that those provisions not be implemented unless and until the department receives written documentation from the United States Department of Education that implementation is permitted by federal law or until the 2013\u201314 school year, whichever occurs later.\n\nThis bill would delete the latter-described provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
