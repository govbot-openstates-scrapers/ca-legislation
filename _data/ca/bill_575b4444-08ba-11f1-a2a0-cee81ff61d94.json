Existing law requires state agencies, in adopting, amending, or repealing a major regulation, as defined, to prepare a standardized regulatory impact analysis, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require certain air districts with jurisdiction over a geographic area with a certain population size, in adopting, amending, or repealing major regulations, to prepare the standardized regulatory impact analysis, as specified.\n\nBecause the bill would impose additional duties on the regional air pollution control districts and regional air quality management districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Administrative Procedure Act: major regulations."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
