Existing law provides for the regulation of disability and health insurers by the Department of Insurance.\n\nThis bill would require every full service health care service plan or health insurer, or its delegate, to subscribe to and use the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare credentialing form on and after January 1, 2028, except as specified.\n\nExisting law requires a health care service plan or disability insurer that provides coverage for mental health and substance use disorders and that credentials health care providers of those services for its networks to assess and verify the qualifications of a health care provider within 60 days after receiving a completed provider credentialing application.\n\nThis bill would, except as provided above and within one year of the bill's operative date, require every health care service plan or health insurer, or its delegate, that credentials health care providers for its networks to make a determination regarding the credentials of a provider within 90 days after receiving a completed provider credentialing application. The bill would require every health care service plan or health insurer to activate the provider upon successful approval and notify the applicant of the activation, as specified. If the health care service plan or health insurer, or its delegate, does not meet the 90-day requirement, the bill would require the applicant's credentials to be provisionally approved for 120 days unless specified circumstances apply, including that the applicant is subject to discipline by the licensing entity for that applicant. The bill would exclude Medi-Cal managed care plans from these provisions.\n\nBecause a willful violation of these provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Health care coverage: physician and provider credentials."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
