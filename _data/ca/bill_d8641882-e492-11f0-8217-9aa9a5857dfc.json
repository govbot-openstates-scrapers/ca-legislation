On January 7, 2025, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency to exist in the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura due to fire and windstorm conditions that caused multiple fires, including the Eaton and Palisades Fires.\n\nThis bill would require the County of Los Angeles to develop a process for specified governmental or nonprofit organizations to notify the county of their interest in purchasing specified types of real property located within an area impacted by the Eaton or Palisades Fires. The bill would require the county to maintain on its internet website a list of the organizations that have provided the county with that notification. By imposing new duties on the County of Los Angeles, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would allow the owner of property subject to the bill's provisions to notify the County of Los Angeles or an organization on the county's list of the owner's intent to sell the \n\nproperty, as specified. The bill would repeal its provisions 6 years following the expiration of the last declared disaster or state of emergency resulting from the Eaton or Palisades Fires. The bill would make related findings and declarations.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Real property: disaster."}, {"note": "", "title": "Real property impacted by the 2025 Eaton or Palisades Fires: sale of rental properties: right of first refusal for governmental and nonprofit organizations."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
