Existing law provides that the south coast district is governed by a board consisting of 13 members and requires the district to adopt rules and regulations to carry out the south coast district air quality management plan that are not in conflict with state and federal laws and rules and regulations. The south coast district has adopted the Final 2021 PM10 Maintenance Plan for the South Coast Air Basin, which includes specified air quality attainment rules, including Rule 1157 (PM10 Emission Reductions from Aggregate and Related Operations) (Rule 1157) . Rule 1157 establishes performance standards and specifies operational PM10 controls for aggregate and cement operations in order to minimize particulate emissions.\n\nThis bill would require the south coast district board to update Rule 1157 to improve air quality and increase data collection. The bill would require the owner or operator of a covered facility, as defined, on or before January 1, 2027, to take specified actions, including maintaining fencing around the entire property fenceline that is a specified height and maintaining open storage piles no taller than 8 feet high, as provided, if the covered facility is within 500 feet of a sensitive receptor. The bill would define a sensitive receptor to mean a residence, school, park, or hospital, among other, similar facilities. The bill would require, on and after July 1, 2027, (1) the owner or operator of a covered facility with a demonstrated history of PM10 emissions at or above the threshold limit set by the south coast district and whose property line is within 500 feet of a sensitive receptor to fully enclose the existing open storage piles and (2) the south coast district to inspect the covered facility monthly until PM10 emissions remain below threshold limits for 3 consecutive months. By imposing additional duties on a local entity, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the south coast district.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
