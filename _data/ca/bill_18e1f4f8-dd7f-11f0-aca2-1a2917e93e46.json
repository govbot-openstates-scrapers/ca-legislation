If those specified procedures do not exist, the bill would authorize the use of the manufacturer's written procedures if they are not in conflict with applicable rules or regulations.\n\nExisting law requires generators of hazardous waste to provide various notifications and certifications regarding compliance to the department, and to other specified entities, in person, or by certified mail, as provided.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize those notifications and certifications to be made into the statewide information management system.\n\n(2) Existing law provides for the regulation of underground storage tanks by the State Water Resources Control Board and defines \"underground storage tank\" for those purposes. Existing law excludes certain tanks from the definition of \"underground storage tank,\" including, but not limited to, a tank holding hydraulic fluid for a closed loop mechanical system that uses compressed air or hydraulic fluid to operate lifts, elevators, and other similar devices.\n\nThis bill would instead exclude from that definition a tank holding hydraulic fluid or dielectric fluid for a closed loop mechanical system that uses compressed air, hydraulic fluid, or dielectric fluid to operate lifts, to operate elevators, to act as an electric cooling or insulation system, and other similar devices."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
