The act requires the department to deposit those amounts into the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. The fund is continuously appropriated to, among other things, pay refund values and administrative fees to processors that receive empty beverage containers from recyclers. The act continuously appropriates $60,000,000 annually from the fund to the department to make market development payments to glass beverage container manufacturers who purchase recycled glass collected within this state for use in manufacturing new beverage containers in this state.\n\nThis bill would require the department, subject to the availability of funds, to pay a market development payment to a person who purchases a product, other than a beverage container, that is made with empty glass beverage containers that would otherwise be sent to a landfill, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to expend up to $20,000,000 annually from the fund for these market development payments. By authorizing a new use for continuously appropriated funds, this bill would make an appropriation."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Product safety: textile articles: perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
