Existing law makes these changes operative until January 1, 2026. On January 1, 2026, existing law, as it relates to these provisions, is generally reinstated to read as it read prior to January 1, 2019. Existing law makes it a crime to violate certain provisions relating to IIDs and motor vehicles equipped with IIDs.\n\nThis bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2033, and would instead reinstate the law to how it read prior to January 1, 2019, on January 1, 2033. By extending the application of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to report specified data to the Transportation Agency regarding the implementation and efficacy of the statewide ignition interlock device program described above and requires the agency to report the outcomes of the program to the Legislature no later than January 1, 2025.\n\nThis bill would similarly require the department to provide updated data regarding the continued implementation and efficacy of the program to the agency and require the agency to report updated program outcomes to the Legislature by no later than July 1, 2031. The bill would repeal these provisions on July 1, 2035.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
