The act authorizes the court to award the petitioner or plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any damages, injunction, or other equitable relief awarded in these civil actions (attorney's fees authorization) .\n\nThat act requires the aforementioned actions to be filed in either the superior court for the county in which the conduct complained of occurred or in the superior court for the county in which a person whose conduct complained of resides or has their place of business (venue requirement) . If a court issues a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction in the aforementioned actions, the act also requires a specified statement to be included in any order requiring a defendant to refrain from conduct or activities (order requirement) .\n\nExisting federal law provides that every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any state, territory, or the District of Columbia, subjects or causes to be subjected any United States citizen or other person within the jurisdiction to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, is liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except as provided.\n\nThis bill would also provide that every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the United States or this state, subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of this state or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the United States Constitution, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. The bill would apply the aforementioned venue and order requirements and attorney's fees authorization to actions under this provision. The bill would make its provisions severable.\n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Wages: behavioral health and medical-surgical employees."}, {"note": "", "title": "Vending machines."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
