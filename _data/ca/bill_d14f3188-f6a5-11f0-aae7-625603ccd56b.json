Prior law further authorized an owner or landlord to adjust the rent payable under the lease during the time the person who is at risk of homelessness is occupying the dwelling unit, as compensation for the occupancy of that person, and required the terms regarding the rent payable in those circumstances to be agreed to in writing by the owner or landlord and the tenant. \n\nThis bill, until January 1, 2031, would reinstate the above-described provisions, and would include certain new provisions regarding occupancy. The bill would additionally define \"person at risk of homelessness\" to include any person who is displaced from their residence as a result of a disaster in a disaster-stricken area in which a state of emergency has been proclaimed by the Governor. The bill, among other things, would permit a tenant, with written approval of the owner or landlord, to temporarily permit the occupancy of their dwelling unit by a person who is at risk of homelessness and one or more common household pets owned or otherwise maintained by the person. The bill would provide that if the lease or rental agreement authorizes the landlord to charge a separate or additional rent for the ownership or otherwise maintenance of the common household pet in the tenant's dwelling unit, the rent payable may be adjusted to include separate or additional rent during the time the person owns or otherwise maintains the pet. \n\nThis bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
