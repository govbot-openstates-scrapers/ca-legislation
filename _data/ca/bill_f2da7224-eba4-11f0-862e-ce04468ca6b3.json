Existing law categorizes ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance.\n\nExisting law makes it a crime to transport, import, sell, furnish, administer, or give away, including to offer or attempt to transport, import, sell, furnish, administer, or give away, specified controlled substances. Existing law makes a violation of that provision punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for 3, 4, or 5 years, except as specified. Existing law, with a specified exception, makes it a crime to possess for sale or sell ketamine. Existing law makes a violation of that provision punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or in the state prison.\n\nThis bill would instead make a violation of that provision punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or for 3, 4, or 5 years. The bill would also make it a crime to transport, import, furnish, administer, or give away, offer to transport, import, furnish, administer, or give away, or attempt to import or transport ketamine into this state, except as specified. The bill would make a violation of these prohibitions punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for 3, 4, or 5 years. By creating a new crime and expanding the penalties for a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
