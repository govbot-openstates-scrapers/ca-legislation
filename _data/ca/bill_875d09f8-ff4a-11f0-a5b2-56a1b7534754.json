Existing law requires that the MOU include provisions addressing, among other things, the establishment and operation of an interagency leadership team.\n\nExisting law requires the Secretary of California Health and Human Services and the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a joint interagency resolution team consisting of representatives from specified state departments to support implementation of those MOUs, among other functions.\n\nExisting law requires the resolution team to develop and submit certain recommendations to the Legislature on various items, including a statewide plan for any additional development needed for a trauma-informed, therapeutic continuum of care to support youth in-state in the least restrictive setting. Existing law requires the team to track and report deidentified information of children and nonminor dependents in foster care who have been assisted to preserve, or secure new, intensive therapeutic options.\n\nThis bill would require a county, in collaboration with the leadership team, inclusive of tribes, to submit plans to the resolution team describing how the county intends to ensure that coordinated, timely, and trauma-informed services are provided to children and youth in foster care who have experienced severe trauma. The bill would require the county to submit the first plan by January 1, 2027, and to submit updated plans every 2 years thereafter.\n\nThe bill would require the county to take into consideration certain information regarding the placement and service options available to county child welfare agencies and county probation departments for children and youth in foster care who have experienced severe trauma, as specified.\n\nBy creating new duties for counties relating to those plans, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Foster youth: trauma-informed, therapeutic continuum of care."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
