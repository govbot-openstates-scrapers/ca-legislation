The bill would require that the Secretary publish the list of identified geographic areas on its internet website and provide it to local elections officials, as specified. The bill would require a local elections official to include a notice in a vote by mail ballot mailed to a voter whose residence is in an identified area. By imposing new duties on local elections officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
