CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nCEQA makes various legislative findings and declarations regarding the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state and states the intent of the Legislature for state agencies to regulate activities so that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage.\n\nThis bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those findings and declarations and to the statement of intent."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
