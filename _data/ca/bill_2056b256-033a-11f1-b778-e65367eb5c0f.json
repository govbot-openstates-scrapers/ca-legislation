Existing law provides various requirements for the board when determining adjudication of water rights, including, among other things, performing a detailed field investigation of a stream system, as defined, issuing an order of determination, providing notice and a hearing process, and filing a final order.\n\nThis bill would revise the above-described provisions regarding the board's statutory adjudication of water rights during an investigation of a stream system to, among other things, require representatives of the board to investigate in detail the use of water with the authority, but no requirement, to conduct a field investigation, authorize the board, if the board determines that the information provided by the person, as specified, is inadequate, to issue information orders that require claimants to submit reports of water use from the stream system through a form provided by the board, and require claimants to respond to that order within 75 days of the date of issuance by the board.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes procedures for reconsideration and amendment of specified decisions and orders of the board. Existing law authorizes any party aggrieved by a specified decision or order of the board to file, not later than 30 days from the date of final board action, a petition for writ of mandate for judicial review of the decision or order.\n\nThis bill would apply the procedures for reconsideration, amendment, and judicial review to decisions and orders of the board issued pursuant to the provisions described above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
