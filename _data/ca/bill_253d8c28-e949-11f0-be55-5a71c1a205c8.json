Existing law requires the department to prepare an annual report to the Legislature that, among other things, identifies education and employment trends in the health care profession and describes the health care workforce program outcomes and effectiveness. Existing law requires health facilities and clinics, among others, to annually report to the department specified information on forms supplied by the department.\n\nThis bill would require health facilities, clinics, home health agencies, and hospices, as defined, to additionally report whether their health care employees eligible for employer-sponsored health care are eligible for health care coverage at the commencement of employment without a waiting period, as defined. If not all employees are eligible without a waiting period, the bill would require the entities listed above to report the length of the waiting period if it applies to all eligible employees, and, if different waiting periods apply to different classifications of employees, as specified, the length of the waiting period for each classification. The bill would require the department to integrate this reporting obligation with existing reports and would not require those specified entities to report if they are not required to file reports with the department. The bill would require the department to post this information on its internet website on at least an annual basis."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
