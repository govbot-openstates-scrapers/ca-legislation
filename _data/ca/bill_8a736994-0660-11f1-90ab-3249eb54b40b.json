Any voter may apply to the county elections official to serve as a precinct board member.\n\nThis bill would instead require precinct board members to be randomly selected by the elections official. The Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to furnish each elections official with the current list of the names, addresses, and other identifying information of persons residing in the county who are 18 years of age or older and hold a current driver's license or identification card. The bill would make every voter in the jurisdiction eligible to be selected, with specified exceptions.\n\nA person who is selected to serve as a precinct board member would be authorized to apply to the county elections official to be excused from service as a precinct board member for undue hardship upon themselves or the public. A person excused for undue hardship would be automatically selected to serve as a precinct board member in the following election. The bill would also authorize a person who is 70 years of age or older to choose to be excused. The bill would make other conforming changes to the process for selecting precinct board members.\n\nBy increasing the duties of local elections officials with respect to conducting elections, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
