Existing federal law authorizes a state, under certain circumstances, to expand eligibility for the ILP to former foster youth who have not attained 23 years of age. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services, with the approval of the federal government, to amend the foster care state plan to permit all eligible children to be served by the ILP up to 21 years of age.\n\nThe Personal Income Tax Law allows a refundable foster youth tax credit for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, to a qualified taxpayer in a specified amount multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor, as provided.\n\nThis bill, the Foster Outreach and Support for Tax Education Readiness (FOSTER) Act, would require, by no later than July 30, 2026, the department to issue guidance to county welfare departments and juvenile probation departments with information to support best practices for nonminor dependents to file state and federal income tax returns and to access the foster youth tax credit. The bill would require the guidance to be updated as needed and reissued no less than every 2 years. The bill would specify the information to be included in the guidance issued, including, but not limited to, the eligibility requirements for the foster youth tax credit and the maximum credit available, outreach strategies to increase awareness among nonminor dependents and former foster youth about the foster youth tax credit, and resources from the Internal Revenue Service website for identifying local Volunteer Income Tax Assistance providers. The bill would require county welfare departments and juvenile probation departments to annually send by mail to every nonminor dependent information about filing state and federal income tax returns and, among other things, the foster youth tax credit and information about local Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, as specified. By increasing the duties of county welfare departments and juvenile probation departments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
