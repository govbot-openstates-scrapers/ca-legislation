Under that program, the State Department of Education is required to award a minimum of 25 one-time Dual Language Immersion Grants over a period of 3 fiscal years of up to $380,000 per grant to an eligible entity to expand or establish dual language immersion programs.\n\nThis bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2027, to designate a Dual Language Immersion Coordinator to provide coordination between local educational agencies, as defined, to share resources and knowledge on dual language immersion programs, as defined. The bill would require the Dual Language Immersion Coordinator to (1) act as the point of contact within the department for local educational agencies seeking to, among other things, establish new or expand existing dual language immersion programs, and (2) establish, publish, and maintain on the department's internet website, on or before January 1, 2028, a directory of operative dual language immersion programs, as specified. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on local educational agencies relating to the establishment and maintenance of the directory, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
