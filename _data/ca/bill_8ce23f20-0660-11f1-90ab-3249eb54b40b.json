The act requires the department to deposit those amounts into the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. The act defines \"beverage\" to include, among other things, noncarbonated water, carbonated and noncarbonated fruit drinks, and vegetable juice, as specified.\n\nThis bill would exempt a distributor from making redemption payments to the department for filled beverage containers containing the above-described beverages that the distributor donates to an organization located in California that is exempt from federal income taxation, as specified. The bill would require the distributor to prepare and maintain records of the donations, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
