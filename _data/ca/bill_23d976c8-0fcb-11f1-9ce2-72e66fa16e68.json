Existing law requires a full service health care service plan, excluding a Medi-Cal managed care plan, or its delegate, to subscribe to and use the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare credentialing form on and after January 1, 2028. On and after January 1, 2027, existing law requires a health care service plan, excluding a Medi-Cal managed care plan, or its delegate, that credentials health care providers for its networks to make a determination regarding the credentials of a provider within 90 days after receiving a completed provider credentialing application.\n\nThis bill would extend the application of the above-described requirements to Medi-Cal managed care plans. Because a willful violation of these requirements by a Medi-Cal managed care plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
