Existing law further makes it unlawful for a person, firm, or corporation, except as specified, to furnish to a person who is under 18 years of age any etching cream or aerosol container of paint without first obtaining bona fide evidence of majority and identity. Existing law punishes a violation of these provisions as a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would make it unlawful for a person, firm, or corporation to sell to another person, who is in fact under 18 years of age, an over-the-counter anti-aging skin care product or anti-aging cosmetic product that lists as an ingredient vitamin A or an alpha hydroxy acid without first verifying the purchaser's age and identity. The bill would define \"verifying age and identity\" to include, among other things, verbally asking the buyer's age and asking for documents that are evidence of age and identity related to the age-based prohibitions for aerosol paint and etching cream."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
