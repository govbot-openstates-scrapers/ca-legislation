Existing law, the Seymour-Campbell Student Success Act of 2012, provides that the purpose of the act is to increase California community college student access and success by providing effective core matriculation services of orientation, assessment and placement, counseling, and other education planning services, and academic interventions.\n\nThis bill would require the board of governors to require all community colleges to award degrees and certificates retroactively in accordance with specified provisions. The bill would require, commencing with the 2026\u201327 academic year, a community college, before the beginning of the spring term of the academic year, to identify students who, during the previous 5 academic years, (1) have completed the semester or quarter units required to receive a degree or certificate, (2) need 12 semester units or 18 quarter units, or less, to complete the minimum number of units required to receive a degree or certificate, or (3) have completed the general education transfer requirements, and to notify those students, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require, beginning in September 2026, a community college to annually identify and notify new and returning students who do not have an education plan and ensure that the students identified receive education plans before the end of their first academic year, as provided.\n\nBy imposing additional duties on community colleges, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Postsecondary education: student access and success."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
