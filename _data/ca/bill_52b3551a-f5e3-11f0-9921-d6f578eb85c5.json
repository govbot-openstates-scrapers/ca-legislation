Existing law, until December 31, 2025, also prohibits an employer from refusing to employ, terminating, reducing compensation, or taking other adverse action against a laid-off employee for seeking to enforce their rights under these provisions. These provisions are enforced by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, as prescribed.\n\nExisting law defines \"laid-off employee\" for these purposes to mean an employee who was employed by the employer for 6 months or more and whose most recent separation from active employment by the employer occurred on or after March 4, 2020, and was due to a reason related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a public health directive or reduction in force, among other reasons. Existing law also creates a presumption that a separation due to a lack of business, reduction in force, or other economic, nondisciplinary reason is due to a reason related to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless the employer establishes otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nThis bill would extend operation of these provisions until January 1, 2027, except as specified."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Employment: rehiring and retention: displaced workers: natural disasters."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
