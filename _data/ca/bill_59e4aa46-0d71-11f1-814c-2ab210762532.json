Brown, Jr., to develop a comprehensive implementation strategy to track and ensure the achievement of the goals and key actions identified in the state's Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan, as provided. Existing law requires, on or before March 1, 2026, and every 5 years thereafter, the task force to update the action plan.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to identify ways to prioritize those state efforts to reduce wildfire hazards in the wildland-urban interface identified in the action plan for ZIP codes that have seen the largest increases in FAIR Plan policies sold since 2019."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
