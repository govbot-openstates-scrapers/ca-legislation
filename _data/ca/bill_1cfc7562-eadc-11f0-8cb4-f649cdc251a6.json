The bill would specify that the purpose of the agency is to verify a resident's status as an American Freedman, as defined, and create and maintain an accurate database registry of American Freedmen residents.\n\nThis bill would require the agency to, upon appropriation by the Legislature, implement the provisions of this bill, including establishing, by July 1, 2027, the American Freedmen Genealogy Office within the agency to verify a resident's status as an American Freedmen and establishing the Office of Freedmen Legal Affairs to conduct and manage its legal affairs. The bill would require the secretary, with the assistance of agency staff, to, among other things, develop a mission statement and strategic plan for the agency, and a matrix and metrics of success for the offices of the agency. The bill would require the secretary, commencing on January 1, 2029, to report to the Legislature on a triennial basis on successes and challenges in meeting its goals.\n\nThis bill would require the Senate and Assembly to annually conduct hearings to review agency performance, investigate issues, and ensure agency accountability. The bill would require the secretary to appear at those hearings. The bill would require, commencing January 1, 2028, and every 3 years thereafter, the agency to submit a report to the Legislature on its activities and performance. The bill would also require, commencing January 1, 2029, and every 5 years thereafter, through the California State Auditor, the Legislature to request performance and financial audits of the agency and make recommendations for improvement or corrective legislation.\n\nThis bill would prohibit personal information of American Freedmen residents obtained under this act from being shared outside the agency, except as necessary to fulfill the agency's purpose. The bill would also require interagency sharing of personal information about American Freedmen residents to be limited to demographics only, except as necessary to fulfill the agency's purposes. The bill would prohibit the agency from using any agency resources, including, but not limited to, agency funds, personnel, and infrastructure, to directly or indirectly participate or assist in law enforcement activity.\n\nExisting law prohibits a state agency, with certain exceptions, from employing any in-house counsel to act on behalf of the state agency or its employees in any judicial or administrative adjudicative proceeding in which the agency is interested, or is a party as a result of office or official duties, or contracting with outside counsel for any purpose.\n\nThis bill would exempt the agency from those prohibitions.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
