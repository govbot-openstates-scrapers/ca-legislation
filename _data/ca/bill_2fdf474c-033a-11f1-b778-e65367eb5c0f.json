Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors for counties for which these provisions apply to provide that certain members of these boards shall receive compensation at a rate of not more than $100 for a meeting or for a meeting of a committee authorized by the entire board. \n\nThis bill would authorize the board of supervisors to adopt a provision that would authorize the board of retirement to increase the above-described compensation limit by an amount not to exceed 5% of the rate for each calendar year following the operative date of the last adjustment."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "County employees' retirement: administration: Orange County."}, {"note": "", "title": "Public retirement."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
