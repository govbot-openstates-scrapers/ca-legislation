Under existing law, the commission administers, or otherwise oversees, various public purpose programs, including energy efficiency and conservation programs, cost-effective energy efficiency programs, rate assistance programs for eligible food banks, and home insulation financial assistance programs. Under existing law, those programs are generally funded through a charge on electrical service, which is collected through customer rates.\n\nThis bill would establish the Public Utilities Public Purpose Programs Fund. The bill would require the commission, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to allocate the moneys in the fund to fund certain public purpose programs and programs administered by electrical regional energy networks, as specified. The bill would require the Controller to transfer an unspecified sum on July 1 of each fiscal year, commencing with the 2026\u201327 fiscal year, from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the fund.\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.\n\nBecause certain of the above provisions would be part of the act and a violation of a commission action implementing this bill's requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
