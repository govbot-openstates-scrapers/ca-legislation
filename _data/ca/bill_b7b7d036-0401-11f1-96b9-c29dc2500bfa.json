The bill would require the conservancy to be governed by a board of directors composed of designated membership, including certain members appointed by certain local agencies. The bill would set forth the powers, duties, and limitations of the board of directors and the conservancy, as provided. The bill would create the Huron Hawk Conservancy Fund and would make moneys in the fund available for expenditure by the conservancy, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purposes of these provisions. The bill would authorize the conservancy to accept revenue generated and contributed to the conservancy by member agencies, as defined, which the bill would require to be deposited into the fund. The bill would also authorize the conservancy to accept revenue, money, grants, goods, and services contributed to the conservancy by a public agency, private entity, or person, and would require the revenue, money, and grants to be deposited into the fund. By imposing new duties on local agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Parks and open-space areas."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
