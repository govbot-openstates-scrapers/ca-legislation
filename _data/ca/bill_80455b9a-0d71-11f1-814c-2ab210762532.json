A violation of this provision is punishable as a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would add to the definition of sexual battery the entering of an inhabited dwelling, as defined, and touching the intimate part of another against the will of the person touched for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse. The bill would make this offense punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make other technical, conforming changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
