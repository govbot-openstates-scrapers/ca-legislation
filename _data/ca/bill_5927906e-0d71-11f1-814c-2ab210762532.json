The act authorizes the Department of Fish and Wildlife to permit the taking of a western Joshua tree if specified conditions are met, including, but not limited to, that the permittee mitigates all impacts to, and taking of, the western Joshua tree through measures that are roughly proportional in extent to the authorized taking of the western Joshua tree. The act authorizes, in lieu of completing the mitigation measures, a permittee to elect to satisfy the mitigation obligation by paying fees pursuant to a specified fee schedule, as provided. The act authorizes the department to reduce the amount of fees paid in lieu of completing mitigation measures for a project that conserves a western Joshua tree through the acquisition of compensatory habitat mitigation land otherwise required by law for the project.\n\nThis bill would additionally authorize the department to reduce the amount of fees paid in lieu of completing mitigation measures for a project that involves more than one parcel."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
