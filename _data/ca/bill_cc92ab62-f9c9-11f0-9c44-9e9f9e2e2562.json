Under existing law, a part of the housing element is an assessment of housing needs, which includes the locality's share of the regional housing need. Under existing law, the appropriate council of governments, or for cities and counties without a council of governments, the Department of Housing and Community Development, adopts a final regional housing need plan that allocates a share of the regional housing need to each locality in the region.\n\nExisting law authorizes a local government to conduct a review or appeal regarding allocation data provided by the department or the council of governments regarding, among other things, the locality's share of the regional housing need.\n\nThis bill would require certain types of student housing quarters, as determined by the department, that are built within the jurisdiction of a local government, as defined, regardless of whether they have been issued a completed entitlement, a building permit, or a certificate of occupancy, to count toward a local government's share of the locality's lower income regional housing needs allocation. The bill would require the department to count the certain types of student housing quarters reported pursuant to specified provisions toward the local government's regional housing needs allocation progress.\n\nThe Planning and Zoning law requires the planning agency in each city and county, after the legislative body has adopted all or part of a general plan, to provide by April 1 of each year an annual report to various entities that includes specified information. \n\nThis bill would require the report to include the number of certain types of student housing quarters, as determined by the department, that are built within the jurisdiction regardless of whether they have been issued a completed entitlement, a building permit, or a certificate of occupancy, as described above, thus far in the housing element cycle, and the income category, by area median income category, that each type of student housing quarters satisfies. By increasing the scope of data required to be reported in the annual report, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would include findings and declarations related to its provisions.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
