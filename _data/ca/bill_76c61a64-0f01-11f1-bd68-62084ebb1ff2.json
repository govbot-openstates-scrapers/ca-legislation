Existing law prohibits the total number of thoroughbred races imported by associations or fairs on a statewide basis under these provisions from exceeding 75 races per day on days when live thoroughbred or fair racing is being conducted in the state, with the exception of prescribed races.\n\nThis bill would exempt from the 75 imported race per day limitation, races imported that are part of the race card of the Japan Cup."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
