Existing law requires the advocate to report at least annually to the executive officer of the board on the adequacy of existing procedures, or the need for additional or revised procedures, to accomplish the objectives of the property taxpayers' bill of rights. Existing law provides that nothing in the property taxpayers' bill of rights requires the board to reassign property tax program responsibilities within its existing organizational structure.\n\nThis bill would make a nonsubstantive change to that latter provision."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
