Existing law authorizes an owner to send lien notices to the occupant by email if the rental agreement states that lien notices may be sent by email and the occupant provides a written signature on the rental agreement consenting to receive lien notices by email. Existing law specifies the ways an owner may demonstrate actual delivery and receipt of the lien notices sent by email, including by posting the document on the owner's secure internet website and there is evidence demonstrating that the occupant logged onto the licensee's secure internet website and downloaded, printed, viewed, or otherwise acknowledged receipt of the document.\n\nThis bill, instead, would provide that an owner may demonstrate actual delivery and receipt of a lien notice by delivering the document to the occupant's email address and there is evidence demonstrating that the occupant downloaded, printed, viewed, opened, or otherwise acknowledged receipt of the document."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
