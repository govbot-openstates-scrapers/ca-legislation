The law defines \"mobilehome park\" for these purposes to mean an area of land where 2 or more mobilehome sites are rented, or held out for rent, to accommodate mobilehomes used for human habitation. \n\nThe law caps the amount by which management of a qualified mobilehome park may increase the gross rental rate for a tenancy over the course of any 12-month period. The cap is the lower of 5% of the lowest gross rental rate charge for a tenancy at any time during the preceding 12 months or 3% of that amount plus the percentage change in the cost of living. Under that law, a mobilehome park is subject to that cap if it is located within and governed by the jurisdictions of 2 or more incorporated cities. \n\nThis bill would instead make any mobilehome park subject to that cap. The bill would make conforming changes related to these provisions."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
