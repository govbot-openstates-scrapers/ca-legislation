Existing law requires the emergency notification plan to provide for immediate notice to the customers of the public water system of any significant rise in the bacterial count of water or other failure to comply with any primary drinking water standard that represents an imminent danger to the health of the water users.\n\nThis bill would authorize and encourage a public water system to provide notification to water users in their preferred language when updating the emergency notification plan, if resources are available."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
