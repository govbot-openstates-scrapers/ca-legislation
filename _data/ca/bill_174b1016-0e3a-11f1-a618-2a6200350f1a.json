A person, as defined, who violates the provisions of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor. \n\nThis bill, beginning January 1, 2028, would require all urban retail water suppliers, as defined, serving a high or very high fire hazard severity zone to include incident-specified response procedures for wildfires as part of their disaster preparedness plans, including any applicable emergency response plan as required by federal law. The bill would require these plans to include mitigation actions, including actions, procedures, and equipment, that can obviate or significantly lessen the impact of a wildfire on the water system and the supply of drinking water provided by the water supplier. Because violation of these requirements by certain urban retail water suppliers would constitute a misdemeanor, the bill would expand the scope of a crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would deem the inability of a public water system to maintain water supply or water pressure during a wildfire not a substantial cause of the damages resulting from a wildfire. The bill would also deem the spread of wildfire not an inherent risk presented by the deliberate design, construction, or maintenance of a public water system.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
