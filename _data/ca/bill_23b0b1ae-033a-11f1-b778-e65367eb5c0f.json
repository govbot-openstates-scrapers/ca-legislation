Existing law requires an operator of a licensed alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility or certified alcohol or other drug program to include on its internet website and intake form paperwork a disclosure that an individual may check the internet website of the department to confirm whether the facility's license or program's certification has been placed in probationary status, been subject to a temporary suspension order, been revoked, or the operator has been given a notice of operation in violation of law. Existing law requires the disclosure to include a link to the department's internet website that contains the Probationary Status, Temporary Suspension Order, Revoked and Notice of Operation in Violation of Law Program List.\n\nThis bill would require the department to indicate on its internet website containing the above-described list, in a location and font that is easy to see and read, that notices to recovery residences issued for a specified violation are not included in that list. The bill would also require the department to post on its internet website, in a specified manner, an identification and summary of each violation the department has issued for the above-described facilities and programs. The bill would require the department to implement this requirement to protect the public it serves by providing sufficient information regarding those who violate the state laws it administers without posting information that violates privacy rights and protections provided by state or federal law."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Civil actions."}, {"note": "", "title": "State Department of Health Care Services."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
