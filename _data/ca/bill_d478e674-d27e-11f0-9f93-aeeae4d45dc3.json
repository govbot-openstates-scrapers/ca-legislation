Existing law also requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to publish a new edition of the booklet and requires that this new edition be in substantial compliance with certain federal disclosure requirements regarding the safe management of lead and radon gas in housing, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of Toxic Substances Control to update the above-described booklet to include a new section on thirdhand smoke.
