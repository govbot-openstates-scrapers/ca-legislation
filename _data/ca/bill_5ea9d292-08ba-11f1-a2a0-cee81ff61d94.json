Existing law prohibits a city, county, or city and county from prohibiting or conditioning the installation of an electrified security fence, as described above, except for requiring an administrative permit to confirm a fence abutting a property in residential use, or within 300 feet of a public park, childcare facility, recreation center, community center, or school facility, meets certain requirements. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2028.\n\nExisting law, starting January 1, 2028, authorizes an owner of real property to install and operate on their property an electrified security fence that is powered by an electrical energizer, and used to protect and secure commercial, manufacturing, or industrial property, or property zoned under another designation, but legally authorized to be used for a commercial, manufacturing, or industrial purpose, subject to specified conditions and subject to prohibitions imposed by a city, county, or city and county through a local ordinance.\n\nThis bill would indefinitely extend the operation of the electrified security fence provisions subject to repeal on January 1, 2028, and would repeal the provisions that become operative on January 1, 2028.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
