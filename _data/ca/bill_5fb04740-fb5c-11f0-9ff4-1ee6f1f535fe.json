The bill would require community college districts to ensure that students are directed to services to assist students in complying with the bill's requirements, and that the information shared by students is handled in compliance with state and federal privacy laws. The bill would require the Student Aid Commission to adopt regulations that include model opt-out forms and acceptable use policies, as specified. By imposing new duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Seymour-Campbell Student Success Act of 2012."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
