{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB2077", "title": "Protect the Promise Act.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["ProtectthePromiseAct"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is in part governed by, and funded pursuant to, federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law establishes procedures for counties in making Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and redeterminations.\n\nExisting federal law, enacted on July 4, 2025, sets forth various changes to Medicaid eligibility with regard to community engagement reporting, redeterminations, cost sharing, and retroactive coverage, among other factors, for certain Medicaid populations pursuant to a specified implementation timeline.\n\nThis bill, the Protect the Promise Act, would require the department, in coordination with counties, to verify Medi-Cal eligibility before enrollment approval whenever reliable data sources are available. The bill, subject to any exceptions under federal law, would prohibit self-attestation alone for Medi-Cal eligibility purposes from being accepted for the eligibility factors of income, residency, identity, household composition, or citizenship or immigration status.\n\nThe bill would require the department and the county to fully utilize certain data sets and verification systems. The bill would require the department to cross-reference beneficiary data with certain databases, complete a one-time submission of enrollment data to the federal government, and review information from specified federal and state sources. The bill would require the department to maintain a continuous process to identify changes in residency.\n\nThe bill would require the department to require regular and systematic eligibility redeterminations, as specified. The bill would require the department and the county to identify eligibility errors, correct errors, and recover improper payments. The bill would require the department to establish enforceable accountability mechanisms, including, among others, reports to the Legislature and designation of officials.\n\nBy creating new duties for counties relating to Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and redeterminations, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
