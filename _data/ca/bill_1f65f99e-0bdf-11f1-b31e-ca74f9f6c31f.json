Existing law also defines a \"disabled veteran\" as a veteran who is unable to move without the aid of an assistant device.\n\nThis bill would instead define a disabled veteran as a veteran who cannot walk without the use of an assistant device. The bill would expand the definition of \"disabled veteran\" to include a veteran who cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest, a veteran who is severely limited in the ability to walk because of an arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic condition, or a veteran who has visual acuity of 20/200 or less, among other conditions, as specified.\n\nExisting law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon application and without additional fees, to issue a special license plate or plates to a disabled person, disabled veteran, or an organization or agency involved in the transportation of disabled persons or veterans, as specified, in accordance with procedures adopted by the department. Existing law authorizes a disabled person or disabled veteran to apply to the department for the issuance of a distinguishing placard in lieu of the special license plate or plates for parking purposes, as specified. Existing law authorizes the department to establish procedures for the issuance and renewal of the placards.\n\nThis bill would require the department to issue a special license plate or plates to a disabled veteran rated 100% permanent and total if the veteran also qualifies for the placard mentioned above, regardless of whether the qualifying mobility condition is service connected."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
