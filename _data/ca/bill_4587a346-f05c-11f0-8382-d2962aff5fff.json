The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.\n\nUnder existing Medi-Cal provisions, behavioral health services, including specialty mental health services and substance use disorder treatment, are provided under the Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Services Program, the Drug Medi-Cal Treatment Program, and the Drug Medi-Cal organized delivery system (DMC-ODS) program, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require each Medi-Cal managed care plan, county specialty mental health plan, Drug Medi-Cal certified program, and DMC-ODS program to electronically provide data for members of the respective entities to support member care. The bill would require the department to determine minimum data elements and the frequency and format of data sharing through a stakeholder process and guidance, with final guidance to be published by the department by January 1, 2027, in compliance with privacy laws."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
