Existing law sets forth the minimum requirements for a preliminary services credential with a specialization in administrative services, which include, among other requirements, possession of one of various types of credentials.\n\nThis bill would provide that the possession of a valid license to practice occupational therapy or physical therapy, as specified, may be used to satisfy the above-described credential requirement, but a preliminary services credential issued to an individual based, in part, on one of those licenses would not authorize the supervision or evaluation of teachers, except under specified circumstances.\n\nUnder existing law, another of the minimum requirements for a preliminary services credential with a specialization in administrative services is the completion of 3 years of successful, full-time experience in specified teaching and school related services.\n\nThe bill would increase the required minimum experience for this credential to 5 years and would add experience as a school-based occupational therapist or physical therapist as a means to satisfy that requirement, but would authorize a school district, county office of education, or charter school to request a waiver of up to 2 years of that experience for a candidate who meets specified criteria.\n\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 44270 of the Education Code proposed by AB 959 to be operative only if this bill and AB 959 are enacted and this bill is enacted last."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
