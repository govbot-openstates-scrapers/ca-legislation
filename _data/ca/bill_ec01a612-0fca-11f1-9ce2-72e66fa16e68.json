Existing law imposes various requirements regarding the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station in a common interest development.\n\nThis bill would state the intent of the Legislature to provide an association that complies with those requirements with civil liability protection for injuries and damages emanating from an electric vehicle charging station or its use that the association does not own, except as specified.\n\nExisting law authorizes an owner of a separate interest of a common interest development to install an electric vehicle charging station in a common area for the exclusive use of the owner under specified circumstances and subject to certain requirements. In this regard, existing law makes the owner and each successive owner of the electric vehicle charging station responsible for costs for damage to the electric vehicle charging station, the common area, or separate interests resulting from the installation, maintenance, repair, removal, or replacement of the electric vehicle charging station.\n\nThis bill would additionally make the owner and each successive owner responsible for the costs for the above-specified damages resulting from the use of the electric vehicle charging station. The bill would require that the installer of the electric vehicle charging station indemnify or reimburse the association or its members for loss or damage caused by the installation, maintenance, or use of the electric vehicle charging station."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
