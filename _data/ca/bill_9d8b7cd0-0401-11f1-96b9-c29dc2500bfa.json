{"legislative_session": "20252026", "identifier": "AB1108", "title": "County officers: coroners: in-custody deaths.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": ["Countyofficers", "coroners", "in-custodydeaths"], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Existing law specifies the officers of a county, including, but not limited to, the coroner. Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county to consolidate the duties of various county offices in various combinations, including combining the duties of the sheriff and the coroner.\n\nExisting law defines a \"forensic autopsy\" as an examination of a body of a decedent to generate medical evidence for which the cause of death is determined. In cases in which a forensic autopsy is performed, existing law requires the manner of death to be determined by the coroner or medical examiner of a county.\n\nThis bill would enact the Forensic Accountability, Custodial Transparency, and Safety (FACTS) Act of 2025. The bill would, commencing January 1, 2027, in any county in which the offices of the sheriff and the coroner are combined, prohibit the sheriff-coroner from determining the circumstances, manner, and cause of death, as provided, for an in-custody death, as defined. The bill, instead, would require the sheriff-coroner to contract with one or more counties that have a coroner's office that operates independently from the office of the sheriff, or that have established an office of medical examiner, as specified, or with one or more private third-party medical examination providers that are separate and independent from the office of the sheriff-coroner and that meet certain physician qualification requirements, as specified, to determine the circumstances, manner, and cause of death. The bill would require the county board of supervisors to annually enter into a service agreement or service agreements with those medical examiners, independent coroner offices, or private third-party medical examination providers, or with any combination thereof. The bill would prohibit a private third-party medical examination provider that has entered into a service agreement from, during the term of the service agreement, being contracted by the county or the sheriff-coroner of that county to provide medical examination for any cases that do not involve in-custody deaths. The bill would define \"in-custody death\" for purposes of the bill to include, among other things, the death of a person who is detained, under arrest, or is in the process of being detained or arrested, is en route to be incarcerated, or is incarcerated at a municipal or county jail or state prison, or who is en route to be detained, or is detained, at a federal correctional facility or immigration detention facility, as provided.\n\nThis bill would except an independent medical examination performed pursuant to those provisions from the provisions described above that require, in the case of a forensic autopsy, the manner of death to be determined by the coroner or medical examiner of a county.\n\nBy imposing new duties on certain counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern and, therefore, apply to all counties, including charter counties.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "County officers: coroners: conflict of interest."}, {"note": "", "title": "County officers: coroners: officer-involved deaths."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
