Existing federal income tax law, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2029, allows deductions in determining taxable income, as defined, for amounts equal to the qualified tips, as defined, and qualified overtime compensation, as defined, received by a taxpayer during the taxable year, not to exceed certain amounts, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2029, conform to federal income tax law with regard to qualified tips and qualified overtime compensation, except as specified. The bill would, in that regard, allow the above-described deductions to be taken in addition to the standard deduction.\n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements.\n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
