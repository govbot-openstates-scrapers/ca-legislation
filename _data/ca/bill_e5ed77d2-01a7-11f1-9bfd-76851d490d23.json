Existing law authorizes the Governor, during a state of emergency, to suspend any regulatory statute, or statute prescribing the procedure for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency, if the Governor determines and declares that strict compliance with any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency. \n\nUnder the authority of the California Emergency Services Act, on March 1, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom issued a proclamation of a state of emergency that suspends applicable state statutes, rules, regulations, and requirements that fall within the jurisdiction of boards, departments, and offices within the California Environmental Protection Agency or the Natural Resources Agency to the extent necessary for expediting critical fuels reduction projects, as provided. The proclamation requires an individual or entity desiring to conduct a critical fuels reduction project to request the secretary of the appropriate agency to make a determination that the proposed project is eligible for the suspension and requires the California Environmental Protection Agency and the Natural Resources Agency to maintain on their respective internet website a list of all suspensions approved.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before January 1, 2028, the California Environmental Protection Agency and the Natural Resources Agency to each report to the Legislature information on the implementation of the above-described proclamation of emergency, as provided.\n\nExisting law, the California Coastal Act of 1976, requires any person wishing to perform or undertake any development in the coastal zone to obtain a coastal development permit and provides various procedures related to development control within areas of the coastal zone. The act provides for the certification of local coastal programs and public works plans by the California Coastal Commission. The act provides for limited review by the commission for projects contained in a public works plan after certification and for action taken by a local government on a coastal development permit application after certification of a local coastal program.\n\nThis bill would require, on or before January 1, 2028, the commission to report to the Legislature certain information on fuel modification and reduction projects, including the acreage of fuel modification or reduction projects approved annually under coastal development permits from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2026, inclusive, among other information."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Fuel modification and reduction projects: California Environmental Quality Act: coastal development permits: exemptions."}, {"note": "", "title": "Fire prevention projects: California Environmental Quality Act: coastal development permits: exemptions."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
