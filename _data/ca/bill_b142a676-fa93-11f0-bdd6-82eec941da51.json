Existing state law requires a covered entity to dispense only drugs subject to these federal pricing requirements to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Existing law prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a covered entity or its pharmacy in connection with dispensing a drug subject to federal pricing requirements or preventing a covered entity from retaining the benefit of discounted pricing for those drugs.\n\nThis bill would prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from engaging in discriminatory practices that would impose additional conditions, prohibit, restrict, deny, or interfere with a qualifying nonhospital 340B community clinic's purchase or delivery of a drug subject to federal pricing requirements if the qualifying nonhospital 340B community clinic utilizes a specified pharmacy, including a contract pharmacy, that dispenses the drug to an eligible patient of the qualifying nonhospital 340B community clinic. The bill would define \"discriminatory practices\" and \"qualifying nonhospital 340B community clinic\" for these purposes. The bill would require qualifying nonhospital 340B community clinics to annually perform specified activities to ensure compliance with program rules and guidance from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.
