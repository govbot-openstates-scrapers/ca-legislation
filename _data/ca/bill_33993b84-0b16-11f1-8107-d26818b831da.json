Existing law, the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) , among other things, consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis activities, and requires the Department of Cannabis Control to administer its provisions.\n\nExisting law prohibits cannabis or cannabis products from being sold by a licensee unless specified quality assurance standards and testing standards are met. Existing law requires representative samples of the cannabis or cannabis products in their final form to be tested by a licensed testing laboratory, and requires the department to develop criteria to determine which batches are tested. Existing law authorizes the testing laboratory to retest a sample if the testing laboratory notifies the department, in writing, that the test was compromised due to equipment malfunction, staff error, or another circumstance authorized by the department, and the department authorizes the retest of that sample. Existing law requires the testing laboratory to issue a certificate of analysis that the cannabis batch has passed the testing requirements, and authorizes the testing laboratory to amend the certificate of analysis to correct minor errors, as specified.\n\nThis bill would specify that all cannabis or cannabis products are subject to test or retest, and would revise the retest requirements to instead authorize a testing laboratory to retest a sample of cannabis or cannabis products if either the testing laboratory notifies the department, in writing, that the test was compromised due to equipment malfunction or staff error, if the department requires the retest, or if the department authorizes the request.\n\nThis bill would require the licensee to allow the department to obtain or access any cannabis or cannabis products held or offered for retail sale for the purposes of conducting off-the-shelf laboratory testing. The bill would also require a retailer and any other licensee authorized to engage in the retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products to provide the certificate of analysis associated with any cannabis or cannabis product held or offered for retail sale to a customer upon request.\n\nThis bill would also require a testing laboratory to be subject to performance testing to ensure consistency of results across laboratories.\n\nExisting law authorizes a testing laboratory to receive and test samples of cannabis or cannabis products from state or local law enforcement, or a prosecuting or regulatory agency, as specified, and provides that the testing of that cannabis is not commercial cannabis activity for purposes of MAUCRSA and is not arranged or overseen by the department.\n\nThis bill would require a licensed testing laboratory to comply with the department's request to evaluate the laboratory's testing practice."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
