These conditions include that the person is licensed with the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, as prescribed, or the person submits an application on or before July 1, 2026, and is awaiting approval or denial of that application. Existing law defines \"digital financial asset\" for these purposes to mean a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and that is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender, except as specified.\n\nExisting law requires an applicant for a license under these provisions to submit the application with a nonrefundable fee in an amount determined by the department to cover the reasonable costs of application review. \n\nThis bill would prohibit that fee from exceeding $5,000."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
