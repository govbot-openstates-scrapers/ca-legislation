The bill would, among other changes to KOPIPA and ELPIPA related to protecting the personal information of students, prohibit an operator from using information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the operator's site, service, or application to train a generative artificial intelligence system or service or develop an artificial intelligence system unless it is in the furtherance of the relevant type of school purpose and for the use and benefit of the school.\n\nThis bill would also enact the Higher Education Student Information Protection Act (HESIPA) , which would generally protect the personal information of a student enrolled in a higher education institution, as defined, in a similar manner as KOPIPA and ELPIPA. The bill would make HESIPA operative on July 1, 2026.\n\nThis bill would authorize a pupil or student actually harmed by the noncompliance with KOPIPA, ELPIPA, or HESIPA to bring a civil action against the noncompliant operator, as prescribed."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "", "title": "Commercial internet websites: privacy policies."}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
