The law requires a real estate broker or salesperson, or person acting on their behalf, who includes a digitally altered image, as defined, in an advertisement or other promotional material for the sale of real property to include a disclosure, as specified. If the advertisement or promotional material is posted on an internet website, the law requires the same image without digital alteration to be included, as specified. A willful violation of the Real Estate Law is a crime.\n\nThis bill would require a person who includes a digitally altered image, as defined, in an advertisement or other promotional material for the rental of real property to include a disclosure, as specified. If the advertisement or promotional material is posted on an internet website, the bill would require the same image without digital alteration to be included, as specified. The bill would specify that a violation of these provisions by a person licensed under the Real Estate Law is a violation of that law. By imposing new requirements on real estate licensees, the violation of which is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
