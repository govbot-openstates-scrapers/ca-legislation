For payments made by the state to prime contractors made prior to January 1, 2027, but that have not been remitted to subcontractors, suppliers, and other vendors as of January 1, 2027, the bill would require prime contractors to remit payment by February 15, 2027.\n\nThis bill would require the Department of General Services to monitor compliance with this requirement, as specified. The bill would impose a demerit system, in which noncompliant prime contractors lose eligibility for state contracts for a specified period of time, as described. For contracts entered into or renewed with the state on or after January 1, 2027, the bill would authorize the department to review and rescind a prime contractor's existing contracts if the prime contractor repeatedly fails to comply. The bill would require the department to adopt rules and regulations to administer these provisions, and would make conforming changes."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
