The Sales and Use Tax Law provides various exemptions from those taxes. \n\nThis bill, on and after July 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2031, would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale in this state of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, firefighting apparatus, equipment, or specialized vehicles, as defined, purchased by a fire department, including an all-volunteer fire department, as defined, or a fire protection district. \n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill also would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure. \n\nThe Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local tax laws.\n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by the bill does not apply to local sales and use taxes or transactions and use taxes.\n\nExisting law imposes or dedicates certain state sales and use tax rates for local funding, including through the Local Revenue Fund 2011.\n\nThis bill would provide that the exemption created by the bill does not apply to those state sales and use tax rates imposed or dedicated for local government funding, including those rates for which revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011. \n\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced.
