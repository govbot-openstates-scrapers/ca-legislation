That law also allows a payment from the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account for an amount in excess of tax liability. Existing law defines \"qualified taxpayer\" for this purpose to include an eligible individual, as defined, who has a qualifying child, defined to be a child younger than 6 years of age as of the last day of the taxable year, and who meets other specified criteria. \n\nThis bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, would instead define a \"qualifying child\" to mean a child younger than a specified age as of the last day of the taxable year, as described. By increasing the payments from the Tax Relief and Refund Account, a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. \n\nExisting law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain, among other things, specific goals that the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements. \n\nThis bill would include additional information required for any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Read first time.
