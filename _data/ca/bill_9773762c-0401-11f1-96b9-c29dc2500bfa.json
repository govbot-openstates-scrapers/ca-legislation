Existing law authorizes the court, in an order granting probation, to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and direct the suspension to continue for a period of time not exceeding 2 years, except as specified.\n\nThis bill would authorize a court having jurisdiction to impose punishment in misdemeanor cases, upon a motion by a defendant, to extend the term of probation for a period of time necessary to complete a collaborative justice court program, not to exceed 18 months. This bill would authorize a court granting probation upon a motion by a defendant, to extend the term of probation for a period necessary to complete a collaborative justice court program, not to exceed 18 months.
